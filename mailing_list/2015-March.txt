Subject: [OpenSCAD] OpenSCAD crashing on F6
Message-ID: <54F34A61.4020306@jonbondy.com>

I have a proprietary model that I am trying to turn into an STL. This 
approach has worked with OpenSCAD for the past year.  Today, nothing 
works at all.

I have tried my current OpenSCAD model, as well as going back two more 
generations, but they all fail.

I have tried released OpenSCAd code from a year ago as well as a 
development snapshot (2015.02.05), both of which fail.

The model renders well with F5, but crashes with F6 at about 950/1000.  
Only about 250 MB of RAM is used, so I am not overflowing the 2 GB 
limit.   Win 8.1 64 does not offer much useful information about the 
crash: is there a way to enable debug logs, or locate a crash report to 
send to you?  I use MadExcept for software that I develop.

Since the problem crosses versions of my code and versions of OpenSCAD, 
I imagine that something else is going on.  I had problems with OpenGL 
drivers a while back, and had to purchase a new computer to get around 
that.  I know that F6 produced good models at one point on this machine, 
and that the OpenGL warnings went away with the new machine.

I suspect some Windows "update" is causing a problem.

The following works:
cube(10);

The following works:
sphere(10);

The following crashes.  Maybe it has something to do with intersecting 
volumes?
sphere(10);
cube(10);

Any thoughts?

Thanks!

Jon

We?ve been doing a lot of development recently and some snapshots have been a bit unstable.
Could you try 2015.02.25 ?

The tutorial works perfectly for me.
Could it be that you're using a really old version of OpenSCAD?
I would recommend at least OpenSCAD-2014.03, and preferably the latest
development snapshot.

Currently, we only support line segments using the DXF format. CS5
unfortunately doesn't support exporting such files. The best way is to
import into Inkscape, and use Inkscape to convert it into straight lines.
This tutorial might help:
http://repraprip.blogspot.co.nz/2011/05/inkscape-to-openscad-dxf-tutorial.html

FYI: We're working on importing SVG directly, which would make things a bit
easier.

Make sure you're exporting as a "Desktop Cutting Plotter" file, not an
"AutoCAD DXF" file.

Marius:

Thanks for the help!

Given that I am now having problems with the year-old software that has 
worked up until today, your suggestion did not make much sense to me.  
However, I did download the snap shot, and it, too fails in the same way 
on my proprietary code.  Interestingly, it works with

cube(10);
sphere(10);

I figure something external to OpenSCAD has changed, but I can't imagine 
what

I know that early versions of Windows 8.1 had some bugs causing software to crash, but they seem to have been fixed in Windows itself.

To get stack traces, the best solution would be to build OpenSCAD yourself. If you?re a software dev, that shouldn?t be too hard, see https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Building_on_Microsoft_Windows.

The next thing to try would be to make it possible for us to reproduce the problem. If you could slim down the code as much as possible (given that your design is proprietary), I could give it a spin in a VM. I don?t have access to any 64-bit Windows platforms, but perhaps someone on this list could give that a spin.

Those two screenshots are the same.

I did exactly what you did.
Are you sure you?re just not seeing the object because you drew it far away
from the origin? i.e. zoom out a bit and it will appear?

In the latest version, we have a ?View All? button.

You?re importing an STL file. I guess that it comes from here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:32706
Using that file, your design renders without problems on a 32-bit Win 8.1 VM using 2015.02.25.

Perhaps you?ve found a 64-bit only issue.
Could you try the 32-bit binary, or using a 32-bit version of Windows to see if that makes a difference?

Perhaps someone with access to a 64-bit Windows could give it a spin and see if they can reproduce the crash?

Just move it in Inkscape. I think inkscape places the origin in the bottom
left corner of the page.

If that is the STL you are using in your proprietary work then you need to
fix it. It has one degenerate face.
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n11803/Octopus2_degen.jpg> 

Using W7/64.

For F5 (with 2014.03/64, 2015.02.25/64, 2014.02.26/32) it shows as:
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n11803/Octopus_F5.jpg> 
OpenSCAD does not handle poor STLs well.

F6 for all the above works. And a exported STL is intact.

So as you said, a problem with Win 8 and your PC. Sorry can't help further.

The best solution I've found for this is to use the jsx scripts here: 
https://github.com/jk-keller/Adobe-Scripts

You do have to convert your shapes into line-segments and break them up, 
but the script is easier to work with than using Inkscape, imo.

That is not at all my proprietary work, LOL!  It was just the first 
non-proprietary example that failed, and that I know worked at one time.

My previous  machine was also a Windows 8.1 64 bit machine, but it could 
not run OpenGL 2.0.  Before MicroSoft forced me to upgrade from WIn 8.0 
to Win 8.1, everything was working well.

I will try playing with this on two other Win 8.1 machines that I have 
here, tomorrow.

Yes, the octopus came from Thingiverse.

My previous computer was a Win 8.0 64-bit system.  All worked well until 
MicroSoft forced me to upgrade from Win 8.0 to Win 8.1, at which point 
OpenGL stopped working (unsupported  hardware).  So I doubt that this is 
simply a 64-bit bug.  And OpenSCAD continued to work on the old 
computer: the visualizations were impossible to use (F5 had artifacts, 
and F6 took forever) so I invested in the new hardware.

Please note that the old 2014-03 release worked well for 9 months on the 
Windows 8.0 64 bit system.  I am beginning to believe that OpenSCAD has 
never worked for non-trivial models on this computer. I just did not 
notice it for the last month (did not need to generate those models here).

Very frustrating.

If you are using a STL for the real thing, have you checked it with NetFabb?
As I said, if the STL is bad OpenSCAD goes nuts.

Note that F6 doesn?t use OpenGL at all, so that?s unlikely to be the cause.
One thing you can try is to render it on the cmd-line:
$ openscad myfile.scad -o out.stl

If that also crashes, we have definitely ruled out any GUI or OpenGL stuff.

That works!  Which means I'm in business (at least I can create an 
STL)!  Thanks for the suggestion!

What would you like to do in terms of understanding the other problem?  
I could try other OpenSCAD programs that I have written, to find other 
non-proprietary ones that crash.

If you could find more crashing examples, that would be helpful.
Also, finding more crashing computers would help to isolate the problem.

I have tested the attached .scad with the suggested .stl by kintel on my
machine (Win8.1 x64)
on versions 2014.10.02 and 2015.02.25 and it didn't crush either times.

I tested the "cube + sphere" example too and it didn't have any problems.

I have been using this same tutorial for importing dxfs into my scad files.
Only on step 6 I am using the "Extensions - Modify Path - Flatten Beziers"
with a value of 0.1

Apart from that in order to exactly locate my imported dxfs I use the
"dxf_cross" mentioned here:
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/General#Getting_input

You can see how I use it lines 516-519 and lines 900-903
Code is in BasWheel.scad file
DXF files are BasSpoke1.dxf and rc1_10.dxf (I also have the source svg files
too)

Files can be found here: https://github.com/basile-laderchi/BasWheel

I use Inkscape and OpenSCAD together frequently.  

my steps:

1 - Draw object in Inkscape
2 - Move object to lower left corner of page, align left/right center marker
to left page border, align top/bottom center marker with the bottom page
border (it may help to turn off the page shadow in Document Properties)
3 - Select Objects you want to export
4 - Convert to Path: Path --> Object to Path (Ctrl+Shift+C)
5 - Flatten Beziers: Extensions --> Modify Path --> Flatten Beziers  
(adjust the value based on granularity you need; I use 0.3 or 0.1 for most
things)
6 - Save as Desktop Cutting Plotter (Autocad DXF R14) .DXF file
7 - Make sure the ROBO-Master spline option is unchecked, LWPOLYLINE option
is checked.  I keep the base units in mm to be consistent with OpenSCAD.
8 - import the file in OpenSCAD (e.g.  import ("drawing.dxf");     )

Thanx 4 yer quik reply!  My old digits can't even type that fast.

1) Windows 7 on a 5 y/o Toshiba L505
2) all versions install fine, 2015.02 snapshots do not load when .exe file
or shortcut are selected, cursor hourglass for a few seconds, then nothing
starts, program doesn't open.

I have modified a file based upon 2014.05 snapshot, originally authored by
others.
the script ran well last week on 2015.02.15, now SCAD will not open at all.

Thx., more questions:
o Is this a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows?
o Did you use the OpenSCAD installer, or just the .zip file?
o Just to be on the same page, could you test 2015.02.25 ?

In the meantime, I?ll test on a Windows 7 VM.

Hello,

There is a problem with OpenCCSG and multmatrix. Compare the results of
the following program when using F5 or F6:

translate([-20, 0, 0]) cube(10);


// Homothecy

b = 2;

multmatrix([

[1, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 1, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 1, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 1/b]

])

I add that this behaviour appears with the 2014.03 version on Ubuntu-Gnome.

Message-ID: <54F48C41.4030902@jonbondy.com>

When I run the 2/25 release of OpenSCAD, I see line numbers in the 
editor (good!).  Better would be if those numbers could be of a 
different color (gray vs black?).  Even better would be if the line 
number for the line after 99 showed up as 100 rather than as 00

On WinXP 32:

2013.06 and 2014.02.25 F6 the second cube gets bigger.

2015.02.20 (git 2cf9de3) it stays the same size.

Another possible correct behaviour would be the second cube is bigger in
both F5 and F6.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Administrator Mode
Message-ID: <54F49701.9030404@jonbondy.com>

I never had to run OpenSCAD in Administrator mode, but now I do with the 
2/25 release.  This is a minor pain in the neck, since I have been 
unable to find any combination of compatibility settings under 
Properties that will allow me to do this automatically.  Even right 
clicking and selecting Run As Administrator still requires another click 
before the program runs.

Anyone have any tips on how to make this process easier?

Jon

I think I found it.  If I enable Compatibility Mode for Win 8, then F6 
starts to work again.  I had to do this in both the EXE properties and 
the shortcut properties.

Hope this helps.

Do you still have to run as administrator?

If you have time, it would be helpful if you could do this:
o What happens if you try to run as non-administrator?
o Did the compatibility mode behavior or the administrator behavior change recently? Is there any way you could test with which version of OpenSCAD  this behavior changed?

Sorry for putting it all on you, but somehow, it appears that these problems only happen on your computer. I?ve love to be able to reproduce this so we could figure out what happens, but right now, we?re pretty much in the dark.

I guess the summary is
- do not check Run As Administrator anywhere in the Properties for the 
EXE file: that will cause an unnecessary dialog to be displayed
- do enable Compatibility Mode for Win 8 in the Properties for the EXE 
file: that will fix the F6 crash
- if you use a shortcut, you may need to do the above for the shortcut, too.

What changed on my system?  No idea.  I moved from an old Win 8.1 system 
to a new Win 8.1 system; maybe they were not configured similarly, 
without my knowing it.

I guess this is related to Microsoft starting to force developer validation. As we don?t have any dedicated Windows experts on the team this is unlikely to happen soon. The standard workaround is to have an admin unlock the program. This only has to be done once.

> - do enable Compatibility Mode for Win 8 in the Properties for the EXE file: that will fix the F6 crash

This is still puzzling. We?re waiting for others to report similar issues.

Well, I'll stop updates for now. As they look suspect.

I'll also do an 'Install' in case it makes a difference.

I am slow in applying Windows Updates.

ATM there are 5 important/1 optional, they are:

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2901983 The Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2
(this one is quite old, so I suspect it may have been installed by others a
while ago, so unlikely to be reason for current issues)

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/3034196 jscript9.dll & Address Space Layout
Randomization (ASLR)   (heap/stack changes - highly suspect, read the detail
on ASLR)

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/3006137 currency symbol of Lithuania
(unlikely)

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/3006625 Domain controller freezes (unlikely)

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/3021917 Update to Windows 7 SP1 for
performance improvements  (unlikely)

Optional - nVidia - Graphics Adapter WDDM1.1, Graphics Adapter WDDM1.2,
Graphics Adapter WDDM1.3, Other hardware - NVIDIA ION (???)

On more thing you could try:

Open a DOS prompt in the OpenSCAD folder, and run OpenSCAD on the cmd-line:
$ openscad file.scad -o out.stl

Does this work?

OpenSCAD 2015-02-25 still works (just testing with the LetterBlock

Of cause it could still be some driver update I'm not getting on the

 Basically, it is an Auger that I need to add one turn / blade too and
remove the end drive plates. I suspect it would be straight forward, but
again, I'm not qualified.
 I sincerely appreciate any offers for assistance.

Hi,

I'll have a look and see if it is within my math limits.

You can use the More button to attach a file (then others can look too), or
if you want it private, click on my Username and there is an email button.

 Hi Michael,
 I am attaching the file for you. This is a first for me too, hope it works.
Again, I would like to remove the end parts (round plates) and extend the
auger one full turn.
Thanks for your interest.

Tom, it uses two external files

auger.stl

I'll need those too.

I found thread_library.scad

The auger.scad code, as it is, uses the auger.stl (or _screwplate) as the
source of the auger shape.

Currently the auger_screwplate.stl is a bit broken, and is split in halt for
printing. Looks like this (I've rotated it, it is normally flat):
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n11847/auger_netfabb.jpg> 

Those brown lines are the broken bits. But seeing I managed to print one of 
these <http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27854>   some time ago it may work.

As it sounds like you don't want all the other bits, servershim, tubemount,
drivemount etc.

Back to basics.

I presume you want to 3D print the auger?

What type of printer do you have? What slicer software? 

It would be easier to make a new auger than try to work with the existing
.stl file.

The important parameters are, outside diameter, diameter of the central
cylinder, length of the auger.

Since parameters are defined here:

module auger() {
    cylinder(h=96, r=4, $fn=24);    
    trapezoidThread( 
        length=118,
        pitch=26,
        pitchRadius=8,
        threadHeightToPitch=0.70,
        profileRatio=0.20,
        threadAngle=10,
        RH=true,
        clearance=0.1,
        backlash=0.1,
        stepsPerTurn=48
    );
}

It looks like that is what the original author used, it appears s/he
exported the auger, split it in two and rotated it for printing, then
chopped the end to length.

So if you give me the length of the auger you want, and how the ends should
be (flat?) I should be able to produce one.

Presumably also split in half for printing in a FFF (ie Reprap) style
printer?

Try to run the entire command on a dos prompt. It should not open a GUI but create an STL file directly:
$ openscad file.scad -o out.stl

Hi Michael,
I did use the auger from the cat feeder, it's pretty cool and seems a lot of
work.

 I would like the center shaft the same diameter, about 8mm, the blade
diameter at 31.5mm and the length of 114.5mm, that is the length of the tube
I am inserting it into, I wish to have 6 full blades in that length.
 I printed several of them (split in two as you say) on a MakerBot2, and
assembled one from all the parts for the 114.5 length and 6 full blades, it
worked out great, I only adjusted the original file for the diameter before
printing.

 It is important to remove those end pieces, I need just the auger blades on
the shaft.
Hope that helps.
Thanks very much!
Tom

So you don't need and additional shaft protruding without the blade?

My openscad file was last saved with assembly module uncommented, and
individual parts commented out. This will generate a large file of unwanted
geometry.
I need to use other programs for mods to miniaturize the input dims.
I have .stl for current rev. parts.

I did try to open scad in the dos window, all I got was 5 sec. delay to
prompt refresh.

..and you got no STL file?

Can you try to run ?openscad --info" in a dos window and copy & paste the output here?
If nothing shows up, could you check the system Event Viewer and see if OpenSCAD resulted in any events?

Using the standard module it tapers the ends of the blades:
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n11853/auger_end1.jpg> 
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n11853/auger_end2.jpg> 

So it turns out like 5 blades plus 2 1/2 tapers like so:
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n11853/auger_full.jpg> 

Is that what you're after, or should I make it longer and just chop the ends
flat so there is no taper?

 Dear Michael,
 wow, thats nice work, it looks great. 
(Sorry for the delayed answer, I got off work and had dinner too.)
The ends look fine, they don't have to spiral in, they can terminate in a
straight line, but no need to make any changes now.
 I assume that it is 114mm +/-, the shaft length doesn't need to be any
longer than that.
Will you split it in half for printing? That worked for the other one, I
assume thats the best position for printing?
 It really looks great, I can't thank you enough.
I will be sure to give you credit for your contribution. I will send you the
details of the use in a private email.
Do you need anything else from me? 
Thanks!
Tom

I presume you are talking about the latest one, with the flat ends?

Yes I will split it in half, as well as the whole one.

You just want the stl's?

It is 114.5 long and 31.5 in diameter, as specified. Printer tolerances may
vary the result.

No need for credit, I was just playing with other's code.

I'll do the stl's after lunch (i.e. in a little while).

Yes, the latest version with the flat ends.

Dimensions are spot on.

stl's would be appreciated.

looking forward to a print test.

Oh Nice!
 Thanks so much, you really made my day. I can?t thank you enough!
I?ll be printing first thing in the morning.
 Pictures, and an explanation, to follow soon.

PS, I contacted some folks in our Engineering Dept., I might hear from them,
we had a few snow storms in the last few weeks, very unusual for us, and
we had a few days off because of the weather each week.

Tom, 

On checking it is -0.5mm diameter, due to a rounding error, or rather a
truncation in my calculations.

Let me know if that is beyond tolerance. Relatively easy to fix.

and to finish off, this is the code:

use <Thread_Library.scad>
// slice along Y-axis
rotate([90,0,0]) 
difference() {
auger();
translate([-20,-40,-1])		// I just manually cludged this 2 times for 2
halves
	cube([40,40,120]);
}

module auger() {
	l=114.5;
	p=20;
	pR=4;
	thtp=l/p/10;
	f=p/thtp+pR;
	echo(1,p,pR,thtp,f);
	translate([0,0,-3]) %cylinder(d=31.5,h=2,$fn=32);  // visual guide for size
	
        cylinder(h=114.5, r=4, $fn=24);   		// core cylinder
	intersection() {
		cylinder(d=32,h=114.5);					// chop to this length
		translate([0,0,-p/2])
			trapezoidThread( 
				// had to work out the relationships, 
				// exta p was to expand beyond the tapered ends
				length=l+p-pR+p, 	
				pitch=p,
				pitchRadius=pR,
				threadHeightToPitch=thtp,
				profileRatio=0.20,
				threadAngle=10,
				RH=true,
				clearance=0.1,
				backlash=0.1,
				stepsPerTurn=48
			);
	}
}

Formalities.
As I said, this is mostly based on the  cat feeder auger

Message-ID: <1425369525714-11862.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hello,

I'm having trouble subtracting in many iteration.
 
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n11862/2.png> 

This figure is translated 2801 spheres which are used union function. It
seems to be right, but when I subtract these spheres from lager one using
difference function, unexpected visual error occurs like following figure.

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n11862/1.png> 

How could I remove these error?

In preparation for a workshop I'm giving today, and in the hope that its
helpful to the community, I've made some changes to Peter's Cheatsheet.  My
version is online as

http://kitwallace.co.uk/openscad/OpenSCAD%20CheatSheet.htm

- some updates to bring in line with the current snapshot
- expanded the basic syntax section
- expanded function explanations
- restructured and ordered the entries  
- added link to examples in the footer

It's expanded to two pages and whilst I've retained the css styling, its a
bit problematic for printing.

Please let me know of any errors or omissions.  I've yet to fork in Github 

Chris

function declaration should include function keyword.

I think % no longer means transparent. It means draw it in preview but not
in F6. It does become transparent if it has no color but doesn't if it has.

dear Michael,
 Your attached files have a ?webloc? at the end of the file name when I move them to my computer.
My MakerBot application does not recognize that and will not open it.

 Can you advise what I can do to open them?

Also, how difficult is it to place both of the halves side by side for printing?
 Someone did that with the Kitty Auger and it prints out on the same raft.
Is that something I can do easily, in printer settings?

I appreciate your help.
 Tom

Hi Michael,
I apologize for my ignorance with this, I also didn?t realize I posted that last comment on the forum this morning.

 I guess it is best to send the other format, not the .stl and we can convert it through the MakerBot application.
I?m not familiar with the ?webloc? part of the file name or know what to do about it.

 I was told it would be advantageous for them to be printed together on one raft, but I don?t want to ask for more from you unless its an easy fix.

 I?ll be here all day, sorry you are waking up to this too.

I look forward to hearing from you. In the mean time I am trying to unravel the files here.
(If you prefer, we can talk by phone, if you provide a number I will place the call, that might help?)

Thanks,
 Tom

Tom,

On checking it is -0.5mm diameter, due to a rounding error, or rather a truncation in my calculations.

Let me know if that is beyond tolerance. Relatively easy to fix.

and to finish off, this is the code:

use <Thread_Library.scad>
// slice along Y-axis
rotate([90,0,0])
difference() {
auger();
translate([-20,-40,-1]) // I just manually cludged this 2 times for 2 halves
        cube([40,40,120]);
}

module auger() {
        l=114.5;
        p=20;
        pR=4;
        thtp=l/p/10;
        f=p/thtp+pR;
        echo(1,p,pR,thtp,f);
        translate([0,0,-3]) %cylinder(d=31.5,h=2,$fn=32);  // visual guide for size

        cylinder(h=114.5, r=4, $fn=24);   // core cylinder
        intersection() {
                cylinder(d=32,h=114.5); // chop to this length
                translate([0,0,-p/2])
                        trapezoidThread(
                                // had to work out the relationships,
                                // exta p was to expand beyond the tapered ends
                                length=l+p-pR+p,
                                pitch=p,
                                pitchRadius=pR,
                                threadHeightToPitch=thtp,
                                profileRatio=0.20,

Thanks for the output.

This means that OpenSCAD starts correctly, which is a step forward.
Now, I?m curious if the problems are purely GUI-related or if you can do more on the cmd-line.

Could try try the following?

1) openscad examples\Basics\difference_sphere.scad -o out.png
-> Do you get an out.png file in the same folder?

2) openscad examples\Basics\difference_sphere.scad -o out.png --render
-> Do you get an out.png file in the same folder? Is it different than the first?

3) openscad examples\Basics\difference_sphere.scad -o out.stl
-> Do you get an out.stl file in the same folder?

This is a safeguard to avoid very slow rendering, as subtracting that many components will be very computationally expensive.

Hi Chris,

Good work - I like it!
One minor thing to tweak (not sure how best to do it) is to make sure that a default printout looks good. The cheat sheet is often used for printing, so print layout is important.

FYI, the difference between # and % is:

# is the highlight operator. It merely highlights the object in transparent red. The object still takes part in the CSG operations in both F5 and F6 mode.

% is the debug operator. It removes the object from any CSG operation. Unless you specify your own color, it will also color the object using transparent grey.

I followed your instructions, here's the results:

1) Soon as I entered command, (ex..\bas..\difference_sphere.scad -o
out.png), a dialog box opened in windows "openscad.exe has stopped working"
after typing this , I selected the close program button, then checked around
or the out.png file.

No file was created in same folder, nor in my library folder.

I tried the other 2 commands, (--render, out.stl), with the same results.

Sorry for delayed reply, I had to do snow removal, 1 ft.=4 hrs.

Marius, I re-noticed the above in the other tread & didn't want to hijack
it.

Some time ago I fixed actual_tardis by running it thru the NetFabb cloud
(the NetFabb Basic couldn't fix it). I put it up in thingiverse here
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:131701

I just imported it and it compiled and rendered and exported.

I then tried your two line program and it compiled, but render got

Compiling design (CSG Tree generation)...
Rendering Polygon Mesh using CGAL...

   Halffacets:     12
   Facets:          6
   Volumes:         2
Rendering finished.

I then looked closer in NetFabb, it passes the normal checks, but I noticed
it had 34 shells, and the detect self intersections found a good number in
the text and St John badge. Unfortunately Netfabb Basic does't fix those.

The fixed one has been printed a number of times, so slicers don't have a
problem.

Anyway, I thought this may help in your quest.

As I mentioned in my email, I suspect the webloc is a internet firewall
issue. So I emailed the stl's, hope they get thru.

Here is the side-by-side of the two halves. I'll email that to.

Thanks!
This shows that it?s your OpenGL drivers that crashes, not OpenSCAD itself.
Could you try upgrading the OpenGL drivers to the latest version?

Looks like the same driver.
You can also run openscad --info to see the driver version.

Intel, Toshiba and windows update all say I have the best driver and no
further update is needed.
I hope they didn't waste my life by simply re-issuing me the same driver,
and telling me it's new.

here is the system info directly from driver control program:

Your driver is really old. 5-6 years or so, and googling it indicates that they?re causing problems.
Toshiba probably stopped supporting this laptop, so your best shot would be to manually install from Intel.
Did you try looking at this? http://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/24593

Thanx, I followed the link, used the installer:
1st time thru "hardware not supported"
returned "try re-install?" So I did.
2nd time thru "software version not supported"

Intel site sent me to Toshiba earlier, so 
I didn't expect to find drivers there.

Thank you for your help, Marius.

Ouch,

I guess you need to manually hunt down the correct version.
At least this thread will serve as good hardware buying advice for future generations :)

I tried googling for: blender ig4icd64.dll
and I found this:
https://developer.blender.org/T31423

There are some suggestions at the bottom, about installing an alternate
version of opengl32.dll and changing Window Draw Method in User Preferences
-> System.

The new location for the alternate opengl library is
http://download.blender.org/ftp/sergey/softwaregl/

I have no idea if this will fix your OpenSCAD problem, but I'm mentioning
it in case it helps.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Difference in a module.
Message-ID: <CADfdXdcZ_UMADLPE5q_G7CpVgEdNsB9gNrGsynSRAQViEAo+zg@mail.gmail.com>

Newbie here, I don't really know how to frame the question, but here goes:

I defined a rib to put on this clamp that I'm making.  I had already done
the clamp main body to satisfaction, and I was hoping to add these ribs in
with a union.

module Rib() {

difference (){

cylinder(h = (Clamp_X - 40), d=(Rib_Rad*2), center = true);

translate ([(Rib_Rad/2),0,0]){

cube(([(Rib_Rad*2),(Rib_Rad*2),(Clamp_X-39)]),center= true);

} // end of translate

} // End of difference  !! I expected the scope of the difference to end
here.

} // End of module Rib


difference() {

//-- Main cube

union (){

   cube([Clamp_X, 5,0.01],center=true);

   translate ([0,(0 - Rib_Rad),0]){rotate (a=[0,90,0]) {Rib();}};

   translate ([0,(0 + Rib_Rad),0]){rotate (a=[0,90,0]) {Rib();}};

   }; // End of union

// Holes for screws

translate ([Screw1_X,0,-3]) cylinder (r = Screw_Rad, h=Screw_High,center =
false, $fn=45);

translate ([Screw2_X,0,-3]) cylinder (r = Screw_Rad, h=Screw_High,center =
false, $fn=45);

// Recesses for nuts

translate ([Screw1_X,0,Nut_Offset]) cylinder (r = Nut_Rad,
h=Nut_High,center = false, $fn=6);

translate ([Screw2_X,0,Nut_Offset]) cylinder (r = Nut_Rad,
h=Nut_High,center = false, $fn=6);


 //-- concave_corners for doing the beveling

bevel(ec1, en1, cr = 10, cres=10, l=size[1]+2);

bevel(ec2, en2, cr = 10, cres=10, l=size[1]+2);

bevel(ec3, en3, cr = 10, cres=10, l=size[0.5]);

bevel(ec4, en4, cr = 10, cres=10, l=size[0.5]);


}

I thought that this would work, and obviously it's not.
It looks like the differencing in the ribs is somehow applying to the body
of the clamp?
Rendering the rib separately, I am getting what I expect.

At this point, I expect the two ribs to be sitting on top of a box that is
a bit larger than the ribs, and about as thick.
I commented out the differencing where I drill the screw holes, add nut
recesses, and bevel the edges.
One problem at a time.

I think I figured it out..     Thanks.
This is a lot like Povray, but different enough that it keeps tripping me
up.

Michele

Sorry but i worked on those dependency build helper scripts on Linux/BSD.
Had no access to Solaris. I tried IllumOS but couldn't figure out the
package manager.  

I have updated the Wikibook to clarify that those helper scripts won't work
properly on Solaris, AIX, Irix, etc. 

One thing that may help is trying to build the test suite, not the QT gui,
and to try to set the special command to build without OpenGL (a bit of
googling / searching may be required).

I tried the option thru Blender dev. site, it was for i5 processor, mine is
i3.

Thank you for your suggestion, Doug.

So it seems my puter was fine until last week, scad ver 2015.02.15 worked
flawlessly.
I guess I got lucky, just before my equip. self-obsoleted.

I'll try a rollback, (hate reverting), and if it fails I'll fire up the Asus
my Mom left me.

Thanx again, Gentlemen!

/"One thing that may help is trying to build the test suite, not the QT gui,
and to try to set the special command to build without OpenGL (a bit of
googling / searching may be required)."/

Well right this project is totally stalled.  I can't get either Qt4 or Qt5
to compile, I don't understand the error messages, and I can't get anyone to
help me.

So if I can accomplish something without Qt I could give that a try.  How do
I do that?  I don't even know what to Google for.

If you're interested I could set up an account for you on my Solaris machine
to play with the scripts.  I found check-dependencies.sh to be quite
helpful, though oddly enough when I tried it again today it now claims
everything is "unknown", even the nine dependencies I've already resolved. 
No idea what that's all about.

 I tried rollback, crappy graphics, so I re-updated driver & set it aside for
my daughter.

So I lit up Mom's notebook, and 4hrs. of updates, etc. later I'm off to the
races. I already altered the model's port dims, and added scaling to
individual modules and exported an .stl file to print.

Maybe after I develop this machine I'll revisit the driver problem, with a
fresh perspective.

Thanks to Marius, Doug, et al for your patience with a dinosaur, and my old
equipment.

Would anyone be offended if I were to delete this thread?????

I'll just send it to Hillary's email server,

no one will find it until it doesn't make a difference anymore.

Fixed in master.
Note: This will still break images generated with custom camera settings.
However, we do now have ?viewall and ?autocenter, which may help generate better views.

Does it still produce the same image with the same command line parameters?

Most probably not - the camera settings changed slightly.
..but they also changed slightly from 2013.06 to 2014.03, so you?d have to regenerate images anyway, as discussed earlier.

IIRC the previous change was just add 90 or something similar. Is there
programmatic way to get the same view?

No, we changed the camera parameters so that gimbal and vector cameras now have the same field of view.
Camera handling is likely to change yet again when we get around to using a real OpenGL framework.
..so using vector cameras, perhaps combined with ?viewall and ?autocenter would be recommended.

My assembly diagrams are all specifically posed so I will have to stick
with 2013.06 for building Mendel90.

Note that the actual posing didn?t change, only the FOV, so you should be able to get very similar views by adjusting the distance.

You don't say what version of windows you have.

For Windows 7:

To mark an application to always run as an administrator, do the following: 
1.  On the Start menu, locate the program that you want to always run as an
administrator. 
2.  Right-click the application?s shortcut, and then click Properties. 
3.  In the Properties dialog box, click the Compatibility tab. 
4.  Do one of the following: 
To apply the setting to the currently logged-on user, select the Run This
Program As An Administrator check box, and then click OK.
To apply the setting to all users on the computer and regardless of which
shortcut is used to start the application, click Change Setting For All
Users to display the Properties dialog box for the application?s .exe file,
select the Run This Program As An Administrator check box, and then click OK
twice.

The application will now always run using an administrator access token.
Keep in mind that if you are using a standard account and prompting is
disabled, the application will fail to run.

My understanding of the problem was that it shouldn't be necessary to run OpenSCAD as administrator in the first place.

I recall someone saying it was fiddling with areas of the registry which
required it, vague recall that if may be the first run which sets stuff up.

I just changed UAC to max and 2015.02.25 ran without triggering UAC, NOT run
as Admin.

I just downloaded a version (2015.02.15) which I have not previously. Set it
up, no UAC events.
I've probably got whatever in my registry already.

I thought your last change put the FOV back to 45. Was it something
different in 2013.06?

I think there needs to be user control of the FOV to allow complete control
of the camera. Perhaps I can fake that with scale

Actually no, scale has no effect of perspective when you view it at a
distance to make the size the same.

I have converted over to using the 2/25 release.  The tabs are now 8 
characters, rather than 4 or so (or at least that is how it looks) and 
all of my scripts are wrapping.  Any way to control the width of the tabs?

When I enter tabs on an empty line, each tab character moves to the 
right half as much as when I move the cursor left through the blank 
space that is a tab.  It seems that some of the editor thinks of the 
tabs as having the same width that I am used to, and some of the editor 
thinks of it as being twice as wide.

In Edit / Preferences you will find Indentation width, tab width and tab
key function. You can set them how you want. Probably 4,4 and Insert tab.

Thank you.  I looked for a Preferences icon in the editor portion of the 
screen, but did not find it.  Right clicked the word Editor and nothing 
happened.  All better now.

Might be helpful if there were an icon to see/hide white space.  Not 
sure how often I will have to deal with this.

I might suggest that the default for the tab be 4 rather than 8, since 
that is closer to how things were in the past

In 2013.06 we didn?t use a FOV, but it was implicitly defined from window aspect ratio and some magic numbers, causing different types of cameras to have different FOVs.

Complete camera control is on the wishlist. Currently pending integration of a real OpenGL rendering framework.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] displaying coordinates in 3d preview
Message-ID: <7C39912A771347F89EE134B5CA2BFA26@gmail.com>

I was discussing the difficulties of OpenSCAD for new users the other day, and had an idea that I think might make it a lot easier to use for some purposes while still being feasible with the way the renderer works. There have been a lot of requests for dimensioning, and I understand the difficulties there, but I realized that it should be simpler to just show the coordinates of the spot under the mouse cursor.

The idea would be to identify the "closest" point to the user where a line extending through the view area away from the "camera" intersects the surface of the rendered object, and display those coordinates as an overlay in the corner of the preview pane. This would be particularly useful, for instance, to manipulate features on a imported height map data, and it would also make it much easier to gauge the scale of an object being displayed. I think it would be easier to implement than previous suggestions because it requires only the data output from the rendering libraries rather than messing around inside them (and OpenGL might have a function that would make it really simple). I've done almost nothing with on-screen 3D rendering, so I'm not sure exactly how hard it would be, but it seemed simple (compared to other requests) and useful enough that I though it was worth suggesting.

In case you missed it there is at least a show tabs option in preferences.

I can think of higher priorities for icons than preferences. 

Like cut/copy/paste.

Have you had a chance to try any of the recent releases that provide
coordinate values on the axis markers?  I don't suggest that this fully
addresses the concern you're discussing, but it does give the general scale
of the object being rendered.  I've personally used it (with a union of all
objects allowing me to translate the whole model,) to move the model points
of interest to the 0,0,0 point and then determine the dimensions from the
axis.

It's definitely cumbersome for  fully dimensioning a model, but it does
provide an easy 'determine' an object's scale' capability.  I'm curious how
or if it changes your thinking about the point you raise (if at all.)

In a way this problem has already been solved:
The F6 is in principle only a .stl viewer (The data is not organized yet in
.stl form.)
And there are .stl viewers that allow reassuring, and dimensioning of the
.stl.
So just marry OpenSCAD with an .stl-viewer and all is peachy.

Is there an open source .stl viewer around?

I don't know if it is official, but I found 2015.03 RC3 on the download list.

It has a camera issue of vastly (x4) different sizes when changing between
perspective & orthogonal.

http;//www.glc-palyer.net is a nice relatively lightweight model viewer
that does STL bounding box dimensions.  It's opensource (GNU license).

For point to point measure dimensioning, I confess to relying on NetFabb
Basic.  http://www.netfabb.com/downloadcenter.php?basic=1  Free, not open.
But it does great measurin, repairs and other highly useful features.  It
is the default app for STLs on my box.

Apparently  windows 10
<http://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2015/02/02/windows-10-coming-to-raspberry-pi-2/>  
will be ported to Raspberry Pi (only the Pi 2B with quad core 900MHz & 1GB).
"which will be free for the Maker community"

Does this imply OpenGL? And hence support for OpenSCAD?

Microsoft isn?t very fond of OpenGL, so I wouldn?t have too high hopes.
They do support WebGL in IE, so perhaps they would ship GLES2 drivers.
In that case, we just need to port to GLES2, which is on the GSoC wishlist :)

?Hi everyone,

I am a 3rd year undergraduate, doing B.Tech in CSE from IIIT Hyderabad. I
would like to work on the project on Improving OpenGL rendering for
OpenSCAD. I have previous experience in OpenGL and C++. I have already
built the source. I would like if you could help me get started.

Thanks.

Maybe one could use an alternative .stl viewer like one can use an
alternative editor, now:
OpenSCAD pushes the .stl-file ?utomatically after an F6 to an stl-viewer.

It is the "Windows IoT" (Internet of Things) version that no-one outside of
Microsoft knows how to define. It should certainly not be confused with the
Windows Desktop that runs only on x68 and will continue to do so.

As far as I understand (I could be wrong), Windows IoT will not have a
desktop. Knowing what we know about Windows command shell I really don't yet
see what is attractive about Windows 10 IoT on the PI2.

I have been using OpenSCAD on Win7 and Kubuntu, and I have 3 Raspberry PI1
and will be getting a PI2 soon, all running Raspbian. Although I don't see a
real need to run OpenSCAD on the PI2, I am guessing it should work under
Raspbian already, and therefore no need to worry about Windows 10 IoT?

I don't think you will be able to do much with OpenScad and only 1GB RAM.
Even the most powerful desktop can be brought to its knees by CGAL.

The real issue here is performane. Yes it'll run on the PI, but don't try
any thing more complicated than a few simple shapes. You'd need to switch
to 64bit fixed point, and possibly replace cgal to get it to fly on small
devices.

Agreed. No point in using OpenScad on something like the PI2, regardless 
of OS installed, if you have access to a faster desktop with more RAM 
and processor power.

Given the observation that "Even the most powerful desktop can be 
brought to its knees by CGAL", it would be an advantage if OpenScad 
could be made less resource demanding. The motivation is not  tos 
support something like PI2, but rather to enable more/faster work on a 
powerful desktop.

First of all, congratulations on creating the largest OpenSCAD union so far.
Our parser runs out of memory.

I'll take a look at it, but if you compile your own OpenSCAD, try adding
this to the top of src/parser.y:
#define YYMAXDEPTH 20000

Not generally, as the cost of unioning four objects could be higher than the
cost of creating them.

This is a good place to start: https://github.com/openscad/openscad/wiki/Project%3A-Survey-of-CSG-algorithms
That is also suggested as a Google Summer of Code project this summer, so if anyone knows any smart students who?d like to tackle this, get in touch!

Just googled that. Windows IOT on ARM will support "Universal Apps" but it
will not support the Win32 API. That means the existing OpenSCAD Windows
code will not run.

re: processing with inkscape

you can 'resize the page to drawing' in Inkscape, which helps with
getting expected output. I inserted an optional step below that
describes how it works in my 0.91pre version that should work for most
all versions:

Resize page to drawing:
in Inkscape, from the File menu, select 'document properties', and go
to the orientation section of the document properties dialog, click
the section pointer at 'resize page to content' to expand, and click
resize page to drawing or selection.

"We can make solid surfaces by reducing the step size so the cylinders
overlap but its slow and the result is poor. A better approach is to use
hull() to join adjacent cylinders.

module slice(x,thickness) {
    assign(pa = f(x)) 
    assign(pb = g(x))
    assign(length = norm(pb-pa))
    orient_to(pa,pb-pa)
        cylinder(r=thickness,h=length);   
};

module ruled_surface(limit,step,thickness=1) {
 for (x=[0:step:limit-step])
  hull() {
      slice(x,thickness);
      slice(x+step,thickness);
  }
};"

from here:

http://kitwallace.tumblr.com/post/85509667344/surfaces-rule-ok

which refers, I think, to the image just above the code.

I get:

"WARNING: No top level geometry to render"

There's a rest of the story.  I have no clue.

I've been looking long and hard for something like this.

I'd really like it to work.

Anyone?

Message-ID: <CAALmimn3HXW+JinkV41=U_Pijqqe+T-PSX92j+h5pZPGrFhf4A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, All,

I've been working with OpenSCAD for a few years, and as such, I can
get blinded to better ways to do things because I already have _some_
way to do them.

Case in point.  I want to make a square cover plate and put holes in
each of the corners.  There's a brute force way to just difference()
the plate and the four holes, but is there a "pretty" way to do this?

(crude) code example:

difference() {
  cube([100,100,1], center=true);
  translate([45, 45, -1])cylinder(r=2, h=2);
  translate([45, -45, -1])cylinder(r=2, h=2);
  translate([-45, 45, -1])cylinder(r=2, h=2);
  translate([-45, -45, -1])cylinder(r=2, h=2);
}

What I'm after is some sort of more elegant structure to replace 4
nearly identical lines of code making one hole each.  For this sort of
thing, it's not hard to do it, but perhaps each "hole" is more
elaborate, requiring more than a simple "cylinder()" call
(counter-sunk, threaded, etc) so I'd rather find a nice way to
describe a hole and iterate over some structure that results in ([X,
Y], [-X, Y], [X, -Y], [-X, -Y]) somehow.

I can think of several ways to tackle this.  What I'm asking for is,
is this a solved problem and is there a "best" way to do this in the
existing framework?

Thanks!

-ethan

for(x = [45, -45], y = [45, -45]) translate([x, y, -1]) cylinder(r=2, h=2);

I also often do it like this, to make it a bit easier to adjust the values symmetrically later:

for(x = [1, -1], y = [1, -1]) translate([x * 45, y * 45, -1]) cylinder(r=2, h=2);

Assuming symmetry about the origin, mirror() should do the trick:

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#mirror <http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#mirror>

difference() {
    cube([100,100,1], center=true);
    for(mx=[0:1],my=[0:1]) mirror([mx,my,0]) translate([45, 45, -1]) cylinder(r=2, h=2);
}

?and of course it goes (almost) without saying that you don?t want to use mirror for threaded structures. :-)

For more complex structures and placements, consider wrapping them in a ?child placer? module definition, to decouple the shape from the placement.

Now that you shared this, I see it everywhere (including several times
in library code I was already calling!)

I'm now trying to figure out which form is "more elegant" to me.

The first example puts the complexity in the "for" expression, and the
second example pushes it down a level.

I appreciate all the suggestions.  Once I have the part modeled (for
eventual fabrication and casting in aluminum) and the results are
unveiled to the recipient, I want the code to be pretty enough to
share, so the quality matters to me.

Cheers,

Even though it marks me as old school, I generally separate iteration 
and calculation:

  - loop constructs use integer operands and simple logic
  - operations in the loop calculate coordinates / rotations

That way, even I can figure out what the loop will do and, when I 
inevitably change the coordinates, I don't screw up the loop logic.

Which is why they don't let me use list comprehension... [grin]

Here's what I've got:

You just pasted a whole bunch of mixed-up code.
If you read the article and use the components as described, you should have more luck.
e.g. the hyperboloid code from the article appended verbosely below.

Hey, I don't know why you felt you had to delete your posts but we're all
friends here so you shouldn't feel that you have anything to hide.
We all had to ask for help at one point and reading these conversations is a
great way to learn. In any case, this discussion forum is a bit different
from most in that it is actually just a layer on top of a mailing list ? all
posts are automatically sent to all subscribers so deleting posts has a
limited effect (there was nothing I could see that warranted your
self-moderation by the way).

Anyway, we hope you enjoy exploring the capabilities of OpenSCAD and look
forward to helping you with your next query. :-)

Dear OpenSCAD users and developers,

OpenSCAD 2015.03 has just been released: http://www.openscad.org/news.html#20150310

This release adds a number of features which has been in development for some time. Most prominent are text(), offset() and list comprehension functionality, as well as a better editor and other GUI improvements implemented during last year?s Google Summer of Code.
A summary of changes since last release follows.

The source code, as well as binaries for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux can be downloaded from http://openscad.org.

Lots of thanks go to everyone who have contributed to this release through development, translation, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation, discussions, as well as testing the development snapshots!

Take care,

-Marius

**Language Features:**
* Added text() module for 2D text
* Added offset() module for 2D offsets
* Added list comprehensions and let()
* Added concat() function
* Added chr() function
* surface() can now take PNG images as input
* min() and max() can now take a vector argument
* 2D minkowski can now handle polygons with holes
* Variables can now be assigned in local blocks without using assign()

**Program Features:**
* Added Toolbar icons
* New code editor based on QScintilla
* Added Splash screen
* Added SVG export
* Added AMF export
* Added --viewall and --autocenter cmd-line parameters
* GUI is now translated into German, Czech, Spanish, French and Russian

the child placer code (without for loop) could be something like:

module corners(o)
{
  translate([o, o, -1]) children(0);
  translate([o, -o, -1]) children(0);
  translate([-o, o, -1]) children(0);
  translate([-o, -o, -1]) children(0);
}

difference() {
  cube([100,100,1], center=true);
  corners(45) cylinder(r=2, h=2);
}

Relativity library provides neat functions wrapping for loop and translations.
below codes do the same thing with relativity.scad included.

difference() {
  cube([100,100,1], center=true);
  rotated(90*z,[0:3]) translate([45,45,-1]) cylinder(r=2,h=2);
}

difference() {
  cube([100,100,1], center=true);
  mirrored(x) mirrored(y) translate([45,45,-1]) cylinder(r=2,h=2);
}

Hello,

That's a very good news, thank you.

Unfortunately, at the moment where I write this message, the binary "Other
Linux x64" is not available.
Anyway, this is not a big problem, I am so satified with the version 2014.03
!



Congratulation for the good job.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] mirroring a chamfered cylinder in this part - how to?
Message-ID: <1426092635285-11964.post@n5.nabble.com>

I have the following code, which works well. And does what I want.
What I am having trouble with is, I want the 3rd cylinder to be not only
pointed up from the bottom, as it is now, but I also want to do it pointed
down from the top side. Leaving both sides cylinders "chamfered". So what I
need is a 4th cylinder that points downward from the top.

I can't seem to be able to do this. Can someone help me? Thanks.

$fn=60;

difference() {
  cylinder(h = 8, r = 44);

  for (i = [1:16]) {
    rotate(i * 360/16, [0,0,1]) translate([0, 35, -2]) cylinder(h = 12, r =
2); 
    rotate(i * 360/16, [0,0,1]) translate([0, 35, -2]) cylinder(h = 12, r1 =
5, r2=0);
  }
}

hi,

i'm currently using 2014.03 and wanted to upgrade to 2015.03.

first, i updated my repositories.  then i did this:

root at YGH:~# aptitude versions openscad
Package openscad:i386:
p   2013.01+dfsg-2.2 
          trusty                                                   500
root at YGH:~#

since i couldn't auto-install 2015.03 via apt-get, instead i d/l'ed 
2015.03.  i'm on ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS, and there doesn't appear to be a 
.deb package available.

in the 2014.03 folder, there is a typical "package" directory structure:

bin         dir
examples    dir
lib         dir
libraries   dir
share       dir
install.sh  file

in the 2015.03 folder, there are no directories, but there are 1,585 
files.  i tried to RTFI, but there are five different readme files, none 
of which appear to apply to openscad.  further, there is no file named 
"openscad" (with no suffix), so there's nothing to run.

i assume i have to do a qtmake on this but i can't seem to find info on 
how to do that.

what did i do wrong?  does anyone have any advice?  is github better?

tia!
yvette

Ian,

I never thought of what you did, I was trying to use mirror() but it just
didn't seem to work.

Your code made me do a head-bang, for its simplicity!

Thanks a bunch!

It takes a while for the Linux distros to catch up.
For Ubuntu, your best bet is to monitor the semi-official PPA: https://launchpad.net/~openscad/+archive/ubuntu/releases
I expect it to be updated within a few days.

Until then, the nightly snapshot builds should be based on the same codebase as the release: http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html#snapshots

Indeed , as the author of the article and code in question, I would have been
interested to see what problems you were having with the code so I can
improve the article.

You're welcome.  I'm nothing if not simplistic.  Sometimes excessively so ;)

hi,

first, Marius, thanks for your response to my 2015.03 email.

next, i'm trying to generate a prototype heat sink, which has a circular 
form factor.  i've unioned the fins onto the back of the sink, but i'm 
having issues trying to lop off the portion of the fins that protrude 
from the circle.  (please see attached .png)

i've tried recreating the circle and difference-ing it with the unioned 
mass, but that either does nothing, or causes more problems (which one 
depends upon the height of the circle).

i could generate the fins using trig, so that they're the correct 
length, but the edges are then square, which looks stinko.

if anyone has any ideas, i'm all ears.  8^)

tia all!

Intersecting the fins with a cylinder should clip them correctly.

You could also subtract the gaps between the fins from a cylinder with
difference and the fins would be left.

Message-ID: <1426106540918-11974.post@n5.nabble.com>

I have a question about the new text() function.

I have need of knowing what the size in mm of the text that I produced.
Right now, I have to guess what the length of the text is, to put it on a
cube for instance.

Is there a way to know what the length in mm is?

Short answer, no.

There was much discussion about how to align text() with other geometry.

For now, the way to do it is use resize() to make it the size you want, in
one direction at least, let the other auto size to keep proportions, unless
you're happy to have it distort.

Hello,

I tend to work with the font size turned up pretty high in the editor.  In
the new release, when I close and then re-open a document the font is reset
to the small size again.  I believe the old behavior was to keep the size
used previously, which I would prefer so I don't have to keep resetting the
font size.

Thank you for releasing all the great features in OpenSCAD 2015.03!

Laura

It should remember the font size and it does so here.
Which OS are you on?
Could you describe a step-by-step recipe for how to reproduce this?

I'm using three computers, but the one here at home is running OS 10.9.5.
Step-by-step is:

* working in file, font is very tiny
* increase font size by pressing command-shift-plus a few times
* work in file, save file
* quit OpenSCAD
* reopen OpenSCAD
* open the same file (either from the recent files list or by pressing
"Open" and then navigating to file)
* file opens but in very tiny font again

Thanks for asking :)

Oh.
The remember font size feature only works when setting the font size from Preferences.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] another GSoC 15 Student Introduction - MCAD +
	Form-parameterization
Message-ID: <1426168185623-11981.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi,

I am interested in doing a project with the OpenSCAD standard library and/or
forms parameterization for Google Summer of Code 2015.

The Standard library project is described here:
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/wiki/Ideas-for-Development-Tasks
You can see the current progress here:
https://github.com/openscad/MCAD/tree/dev
https://github.com/openscad/scad-utils

The forms parameterization project is described here:
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/wiki/Project%3A-Form-based-script-parameterization

I am a master's candidate at Georgia Tech conducting a thesis in improving
CAD useablity. I believe CAD is a great tool for identifying and achieving
goals. I would like to make it more available. An OpenSCAD standard library
with forms-like access (or something like it) would be extremely useful for
my research. I am in the planning stage of creating such a tool already so I
was excited to see that it had interest in the OpenSCAD community. I believe
the mentorship, funding, and community provided by GSoC will help focus my
work.

In addition to being a (self-funded, part-time online) student, I work full
time as a product development engineer at a mechanical engineering
consulting company. I have extensive experience with Solidworks and
mechanical design. I also have extensive experience with Matlab/Scilab and
processing/arduino. I am rapidly gaining experience in C++ (I would use C++
in this project). I think that my domain knowledge of mechanical engineering
and budding programming competencies would match well with the GSoC/OpenSCAD
community/mentor guidance. I can commit 35-45 hrs per week to this project
and be available for communication outside 8am-6pm EST.

Please contact me if you would like more information or to discuss this
project further.

Thank you,

Mitch

Message-ID: <1731376480.5481589.1426214901278.JavaMail.yahoo@mail.yahoo.com>

I am running LinuxMint 17 Rebecca and Windows 7 in a dual boot mode.
I am having a hart time trying to install the new version of Openscad 2015-03 onto Linux. For one Qt4 is not installed on my machine but some PyQt4s. www.qt.nokia.com seems to be death, I didn?t bothered in checking the other libraries.

End up installing it on Windows 7 -32bits, the problem: Open CSG is disable. Well I have some big driver issues with Windows drivers on my machine since I removed Oracle?s VirtualBox %$%#.

Will I ever have the chance to run the new Openscad 2015 03?, in other words, are you Folks releasing a binary version for LinuxMint (base on Ubuntu).
Thanks for reading.

Thanks! That's an interesting approach and solves my current problem.
That scad-utils library also looks extremely useful.

However, this raises some new questions for me...

I see "rotation" and "translation" are defined in
scad-utils/transformations.scad and are distinct from the built-in
rotate and translate modules. Are modules/functions not first-class?
Actually, I've been wondering why modules are even a separate kind of
thing from functions...

There is a detailed explanation of how shapes are passed as arguments to
modules, in this document:
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/wiki/OEP4%3A-Unwrap-Operator

This document explains the behaviour you are seeing with the 'for'
statement. There's currently no way to access individual shapes in the
Group returned by the 'for' statement; you'll have to write your program in
a different way. The OEP4 proposes a language extension that I call the
'unwrap operator' that directly solves the problem you encountered. If this
language extension were to be implemented, then your code could be made to
work by adding an '&' in front of the 'for' statement:

    first() {
        & for(i=[0:20:120]) {
            rotate([0,0,i]) translate([10,0,0]) cylinder();
        }
    }

How easily could render() be enhanced to output children?  That could be
useful in other cases as a general-purpose "children generator", e.g. such
as when importing 2D and 3D source material with a view to processing the
sub-areas/volumes instead of the whole.

render(children=true) import("my_pile_of_volumes.stl");

Andrew.

Could you provide some more info:
o Any STL file, or just some STL files?
o Describe how it crashes?
o Does it output anything before a crash?
o Can you provide the contents of Help->Library Info?

My proprietary model is crashing again.  Sometimes it works, sometimes 
not, depending on the parameters that I apply to it (which, of course, 
changes the geometry).

Sure would be nice if it didn't just crash, but rather gave even a HINT 
at what was going wrong and/or what I could consider changing. Very 
frustrating having F5 work and F6 take 30 minutes to crash. I'm wasting 
a LOT of time trying different things blindly.

Argh

Not a simple one.  Seems that if I increase any of the $ values, it 
crashes.  I had to reduce the fidelity of the model significantly to get 
it to create.

I am fine with limitations on the fidelity.  It is the time consuming 
nature of this, and the fact that I'm working in the dark, that is 
frustrating.

Try changing the view to Grid Only (F11) before rendering (F6)?  Sometimes,
for me,  it's the preview window that can't handle it.

For more complex, high-polygon count designs, sometimes it helps to explicitly insert render() operations to flatten a level or three of hierarchy.

It?s likely not related to increased resolution at all. We should never crash and crash bugs have high priority, so I?m willing to dig quite a bit to help you out.

Thanks for the link. After reading OEP4, a number of things are
clearer to me. An explicit unwrap/unpack operator does seem like the
right approach.

Thanks. I finally got around to reading this carefully from beginning to
end. (I now get why you mentioned the JS-style "arguments" thing).

Overall, this idea seems great to me. Is there a timeline for
implementing it? (I'm pretty new to OpenSCAD, so I don't know the
process for OEPs.)

A few questions:

In one place it says,

    "A module is a kind of function that takes shapes as arguments, and
    returns a shape as a result."

Does a module really return one shape, or a group of shapes?

Also, it talks about the two argument lists of modules,

    "The inner argument list is surrounded by parentheses, and the
    arguments are values. The outer argument list is surrounded by
    braces, and the arguments are shapes."

Are shapes also values? That is, is it possible to have an inner
argument that I pass a shape to? Can I create an array/list of shapes?

As an aside, one thing I found a bit confusing when reading OEP4 was
that a few times it mentioned functions I've never heard of and could
not find documentation for, like flatten and append.  It might be nice
to link to further info about each of these the first time they are
mentioned.

Message-ID: <CAJbtQC_iks_1rKKGJsgk8PGn-yjDTS1tqpB9me797Ckwv-9y5A@mail.gmail.com>

I just started using OpenSCAD a few weeks ago, and initially just used
the binary in Ubuntu 14.04's apt repo ("2013.01+dfsg-2.2"). More
recently I switched to building the source from the openscad/openscad
repo on github. (I'm just building whatever's currently in the master
branch.)

Overall, the new version is a huge improvement (thanks everyone who
works on it!) but there are a few quirks in my build. I'm not sure if
these are actual bugs, things wrong with the way I'm building it, or
just seem odd to me because my workflow is atypical:

1. The font in the editor is a cursive script font. This isn't a big
   deal for me, as I don't really use the internal editor, but I'm
   worried it might be a symptom of a bigger problem. Here's a
   screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/Rs4z02V.png

2. I haven't been able to find any way to get into the preferences.
   There are no menus, unlike the old version. Among other things, this
   means I haven't found a way to adjust the font.

3. As I mentioned, I don't normally use the internal editor, but a
   couple of the controls that are useful to me only exist when the
   editor pane is open. In particular, "Export as STL".  "Open" might
   also be nice.

   As an aside, I'm not sure why the editor has preview and render
   buttons, as these seem like viewer controls.

There's a conflict between OEP2 and OEP4, and Marius indicated that
this is still an unresolved issue.

A module returns a single object, which is either a shape or a group (I
consider a group to be a special kind of shape).

No. Shapes and values live in disjoint universes. The two kinds of objects
are computed during different phases of evaluation. I understand it would
take a significant refactoring of the OpenSCAD internals to change this.

append() is a built-in function, and should be in the user manual.
flatten() is an auxiliary function that I have seen people define in some
source files to work around a deficiency in array comprehensions. I'm not
sure if anybody has ever put flatten() into a library.

I don't think so in the latest release. Are you thinking of concat?

Yes I'm thinking of concat. Sorry, I got OpenSCAD and Lisp mixed up in my
head when I was writing OEP4. I'll need to update it now. Thanks for
pointing out my error.

I think you have some problems.

1. Is not normal.
2. There should be a menu, regardless if editor being hidden or not.
3. That is normal, maybe request a change to add it to the view toolbar, but
when you get menus back you can still do it that way.

Sorry I can't help with build problems.

1. Getting a weird font may be a symptom of a yet unknown bug
2. That is weird. To eliminate a local build issue, could you try installing
a development snapshot and see if that changes anything?
http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html#snapshots
The dev snapshot is currently equivalent to the release for most practical
purposes, except logo and version number.

I will do a careful study next week, writing down the parameters and 
noting the results.  At the moment, my impression is that these crashes 
occur erratically, unpredictably. At 30 minutes per run, it will take 
some time.

How to I export my .scad file into .stl format?
Does it work the same for a 3D printer?


If anyone has tips on using (step by step) OpenSCAD with a 3D printer it
would be very helpful. Thank you very much.

I just use the Export STL in the menu and then send the resulting file 
to my printer software. I'm running an Afinia H479 and the software 
handles all the slicing functions. Someone using a different printer may 
have a different approach.

The .stl format is just one of several possible *intermediate* 
representations, although a very common one.  If you limit the 3D 
printer" to be the printer hardware, onboard electronics + firmware 
only, then your typical 3D printer does not actually understand .stl at all.

The printer firmware expects "G-code" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code

After saving your .scad to .stl format (OpeScad: File -> Export -> STL), 
you must run it through a slicer program (slic3r, KISSlicer, ...) to 
create G-code. Ignoring some differences in startup and shutdown G-code 
sequences for different printer hardware, it is the G-code that works 
the same for different printers.

I am waiting for my first printer to arrive soon. My idea is to use 
OpenSCAD to create models, save to .stl and then create G-code from STL 
using KISSlicer, all done on a PC.

I plan to hook my printer up with a Raspberry PI with wireless Wifi to 
run OctoPrint. Then it is just a matter of dragging/dropping the 
generated G-code file into the Web user interface of OctoPrint to 
actually do the 3D-printing, completely independent of the PC, which is 
free to do other things as the printing proceeds.

I find such a setup more flexible, clear and attractive than an 
"all-in-one" solution where the borders between the PC, software(s) and 
printer are made fuzzy and hidden for no good reason (IMHO).

I use Repetier-Host to process my STL files and send them to the 
printer.  Free, and highly recommended.

Hello everyone,

My Name is Wisdom Nji, a Freshman Computer Science Student at the
Catholic University of Bamenda, Bamenda-Cameroon. I am proficient in
C/C++ and I've been a member of the OpenSCAD community for some few
weeks. I will like to do GSoC with this organization and it's my first
communication with the open source community. I am interested in
collaboration projects on the BRL-CAD and sister organizations. I will
like to apply for two projects that is Improve DXF import and Export
and Multithreaded Geometry evaluations Projects for OpenSCAD. I will
greatly appreciate any guidance and resources which will facilitate my
understanding of the these projects and also submit my proposal.

I have forked the github OpenSCAD code repository and cloned to my
computer. I am trying to compile the source code and will be motivated
to complete any participation requirements I may be missing.

Thanks for the Assistance.

Thanks,
Wisdom Nji

Is this still on 64-bit Win 8.1 using Win 8 compatibility mode?

Yes, WIn 8.1 64-bit.  Not sure whether using compatibility mode (Win 8 
or Win 7) is useful or not yet.

Hi,

I would strongly suggest getting OpenSCAD built and start looking into the details of those projects.
Both projects will require some degree of refactoring of existing code, as well as significant use of external libraries.
Showing that you?re able to read code, understand the limitations of the current solutions and give good suggestions for how to solve it would greatly improve your application.
If you have the chance to also show that you?re familiar with both C++ and git workflows would make it easier to evaluate your skills and application.

Also, introducing yourself on IRC to chat about details will help us get a feel for how you communicate and work.

Kind Regards,

 -Marius

Hi Mitch,

Your background sounds very interesting.
One of the longer-term goal of OpenSCAD is to help improve CAD usability, focusing on non-traditional CAD domains (i.e. provide a tool for others than mechanical engineers). On of the key components in this is a good, curated, standard library of primitives, parts and operations.
If you could provide some ideas in this domain based on your existing research, that would be a valuable contribution to your application.

The standard library is largely not a C++ project, but as you say you want to use C++: in order to evaluate your C++ skills, it would be beneficial if you could engage with the community; get openscad built from source, read some code, perhaps fix a bug or clean something up, and chat with us on IRC so we can get a feel of your communication skills and domain knowledge.

Kind Regards,,

 -Marius

Ok.
The first step for us would be to validate that the crash is not unique to your computer, since last time, nobody was able to reproduce the problem.

Even though I don?t have access to 64-bit Windows, there are tons of helpful people on this list who are ready to test stuff given the chance.

The nightly worked, and also helped me figure out what was wrong with my
build. Thanks!

Details, in case you're interested:

I installed the nightly, and it had a working menu and reasonable font.
When it installed, apt also pulled in two extra packages:
libqscintilla2-11 and libqscintilla2-l10n. That seemed like a possible
clue.

I tried "make clean" followed by "make".  I still had the problem, so I
did a "git clean -ix" (just deleted Makefile).

I then ran the dependency check script...

    $ scripts/check-dependencies.sh
    depname     minimum     found       OKness
    qt          4.4         5.2.1       OK
    qscintilla2 2.7         2.8.1       OK
    cgal        3.6         4.2         OK
    gmp         5.0         5.1.3       OK
    mpfr        3.0         3.1.2       OK
    boost       1.35        1.54        OK
    opencsg     1.3.2       1.3.2       OK
    glew        1.5.4       1.7.0       OK
    eigen       3.0         3.2.0       OK
    glib2       2.0         2.40.2      OK
    fontconfig  2.10        2.11.       OK
    freetype2   2.4         17.1.11     OK
    harfbuzz    0.9.19      0.9.27      OK
    bison       2.4         3.0.2       OK
    flex        2.5.35      2.5.35      OK
    make        3           3.81        OK

...which said OK for everything. Then I ran "qmake-qt4", which gave me
a warning:

    $ qmake-qt4 openscad.pro
    Project MESSAGE: If you're building a development binary, consider
adding CONFIG+=experimental
    WARNING: /home/laurence/src/third-party/openscad/scintilla.pri:13:
Unable to find file for inclusion qscintilla2
    Project MESSAGE: Using local copy of qscintilla2.prf instead.

Remebering that apt had installed those libqscintilla2 packages I tried
installing the corresponding headers:

    $ apt-get install libqscintilla2-dev

And then re-ran "qmake-qt4 openscad.pro" which eliminated that warning.
Building with that new Makefile seemed to correct the issue.

I don't get why the "local copy of qscintilla2.prf" would result in no
menu, but I guess oddities in the editor (ie: the font issue) sort of
make sense.

What I'm most surprised at is that it was able to build and run without
a build or runtime failure, just really weird behavior.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Crash on STL Export, Windows.
Message-ID: <1426376008037-12015.post@n5.nabble.com>

I recently upgraded my OpenSCAD (Windows) install to the newest release and
immediately I was seeing crashes in STL export on some of my quadcopter
frame files that have previously never had issues.   The file renders okay,
validates okay, crashes the app when trying to "Export as STL" (crash
happens soon after choosing a file path).  Export to other file formats
works fine.

I binary searched through released versions between newest and the previous
one I had and found the crashes for this design started between 01.13
(works) and 01.16 (crashes, as does every release tried since this one,
including latest).  Both 32 and 64 bit versions crash from 01.16 up.

Here's a minimal example of the file that causes the crash on export (the
way it is structured with repeat hole cutting makes a bit more sense in the
full version, but I was trying to cut this down to the smallest thing I
could still get to crash on export):

---------------

mainPlateHeight = 4;

difference() {

This is probably obvious but where I said "released versions", I meant
snapshots.  Snapshot 01.13 is the latest one which will export this file to
STL post-render without crashing.

Hi,

This is a duplicate of #1258 which is fixed in master:
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/1258

We?ll release an update to 2015.03 to address various critical bugs in a week or two.

At the moment, all I know is that a proprietary SCAD file is crashing at 
times.  Since I cannot deliver that code, it is hard to know how to have 
others help.  I appreciate the offer, though.

I modiefied the code a bit to improve the difference. This will cure the
display with f5 and I guess it will cure your stl export problems too:

mainPlateHeight = 4;


difference() {

cylinder(d = 230, h = mainPlateHeight);


 for (rot = [0, 90, 180, 270]) {

rotate([0, 0, rot]) {

translate([0, 160, -1]) {

cylinder(d = 214, h = mainPlateHeight+2);

}

}

}

}


translate([0, 0, -6]) {

difference() {

cylinder(d = 230, h = mainPlateHeight + 6);


 for (rot = [0, 90, 180, 270]) {

rotate([0, 0, rot]) {

translate([0, 160, -1]) {

cylinder(d = 214, h = mainPlateHeight + 6+2);

}

}

}


 translate([0, 0, -130]) {

sphere(r = 150);

}

}

}

Subject: [OpenSCAD] rotate_extrude() preview question
Message-ID: <1426448686411-12028.post@n5.nabble.com>

Maybe this is an old issue but this code previews incorrectly in Version
2015.03:

intersection() {
    cube(size=[100, 100, 100]);
    rotate_extrude(convexity=10) translate(v=[40,0,0]) circle(d=10);
} 

But changing convexity to 1 previews just fine (and 1 seems to be the only
value that works). Am I doing something wrong?

Thanks!

That could be some problem with the graphics driver. I'm not seeing any
problems here (Linux / NVidia / nouveau driver).

With convexity = 1, there's some small places where it does not draw
correctly, with > 3 it's without any display errors.

Can you post the output from the Help->Library Info dialog?

Hi Marius and OpenSCAD community,

Thanks for your feedback in this and on the IRC.

Here is a status update and proposed path forward:
-I discussed the status of the MCAD libraries with Kintel and teepee.
-I built openSCAD from source on ubuntu. (I am primarily a windows user but
expect to use ubuntu for this project)
-I ran some models with the the MCAD library and read through the library's
structure.

Path forward:
-I will reach out to hyperair who has been working on the MCAD library.
-I will make a sample parts library for MCAD to demonstrate my capability.
-I will draft a list of MCAD content and requirements
-I will sketch a rough MCAD organization plan and documentation structure.
--I intend to do this work tonight into the next couple of days. Look for me
on IRC.
--I welcome any suggestions or comments.

Thank you!

Mitch

First clue is that after crashing 5 times in a row with "$fa=5", when I 
removed that, it stopped crashing twice in a row.  I will try to create 
a non-proprietary test case.

Hi,

Thanks for your email and sorry for late response.
Note that the projects posted for GSoC are rough suggestions for projects. I would strongly recommend that you familiarize yourself with OpenSCAD and the code, to be able to write a good project proposal.
The best would be to find us on IRC as well as ask concrete questions here.
To get your feet wet, you can also search for github issues tagged ?Low Hanging?  - that could be a good start for getting to know the workflows.

 -Marius

Until you want to cut and paste them.

Also you then have to internationalize it because that use of comma is
not even a pan-european thing.

That would be locale dependent. Not sure if I want to go there as that causes problems for other software.

How about

or

CGAL usage: 123456789 (123 456 789)

The following code crashed F6 after perhaps 45 minutes, consuming 1.7 GB 
of RAM.  It renders in under 1 second using F5. I realize that it is a 
bizarre case.  I only submit it because it demonstrates a way to have F5 
work but F6 crash on my machine.  I look forward to others trying it.

$fa=1;

translate([0, 100, 0])
difference() {
     cylinder(h=75, r=20, $fn=100);
     translate([0, 0, -2])
         cylinder(h=80, r=17, $fn=100);
}

difference() {
     sphere(r=45);
     sphere(r=40);
}

For info text like that, we should prob. just render a human readable version, e.g. 117 MB

That?s bizarre indeed. It renders in 1m5s here.

Just to recap: Is this the 64-bit official 2015.03 binary, running on 64-bit Win 8.1 in Win 8 compatibility mode?

Could just paste the output of Help->Library Info just so we have all the details?

See screen shot of Help, About for OpenSCAD release I am running, and 
screen shot of Windows info about my computer (OS, 64-bit, RAM, etc).  
Not sure how to prove that the OpenSCAD I'm running is the 64-bit 
version; it installed in Program Files (rather than Program Files 
(x86)).  Note that previous crashes occurred around 300 MB of RAM (but, 
of course, this crash could be due to something else going on).

If you can render this using F6 in 2 seconds, and it takes 45 minutes 
here before it crashes, then something very strange is going on.  I know 
that at one point I considered the new code to be MUCH faster than the 
old.  That seems to have changed here.  I have NO idea why.

Thanks for your help!

When I start OpenSCAD and select a file to work on (from the splash 
screen), focus is not sent to the text editor.  That is, if I just start 
typing, nothing happens.  I have to click on the editor to start 
typing.  Same thing if I create a new file.  Any good reason to not give 
focus to the editor on startup?

It should get focus, and it does get focus for me. This might be another platform or system-specific issue.
I?ll test on some systems and open an issue if I find anything.

Same here on XP. Have to click in the editor to give it focus before typing.

Jon,

Is it possible to provide some sort of stack trace, so we can see where it crashes?
Perhaps from the Event Log ?

I'm trying this on the clean VM I built, but I'm having to do it via Chrome
Remote Desktop from work (over a 4G line,) so I may not make progress until
I get home tonight.

I'm not clear about the Windows 8 compatibility mode that's noted above.
Is that something you're setting in the properties of the openscad.exe file?

on Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS, running openscad 2014.03, it took 37 seconds. 
system monitor shows openscad as using 782MB of storage (still open).

i would test 2015.03, but i'm having build issues on ubuntu.  8^(

That definitely looks like an ATI driver crash.
Could you try installing some other versions of the driver and see if that helps?

..or perhaps even turn off acceleration (not sure how that works under Windows though).

i installed the 2015.03.14 nightly build, rendered (F6) this in two 
seconds (!), and i love the new "measurement" stuff in the "view object" 
window!

Downloading the 3rd set of drivers in the last 30 minutes.  Each one is 
"best" but this one claims to be best-er.  We will see.

Marius: are you saying that the little test script executes F6 in 2-3 
seconds on your computer?  I'm running eight cores at 4 GHz with 8 GB of 
RAM and it takes 18 minutes and then crashes.  I can imagine something 
about the video drivers that might have a problem with the data that F6 
creates, but I cannot understand how that might make the underlying 
calculations take that much longer.  Does OpenSCAD use video cores for 
computations, in addition to CPU cores?

Running 2015.03 on 64 bit Windows 8.1 in normal (not compatibility) mode I
can successfully F5 and F6 the test code.  F6 takes 2 minutes, 46 seconds to
run.

Running on the same machine in Windows 8 compatibility mode, F5 works, but
F6 is sucking up hordes of memory and taking forever (over 20 minutes so
far.)

(This is my Win 8.1 laptop running 2015.03, the VM is giving me fits and
refusing to step up to OpenGL 2.0 or better.)

So I am seeing something problematic, but without knowing the specifics of
what stepping down to Win 8 compatibility from Win 8.1, I can't say what it
might be.

Tim:

Right you are.  Once I remove the compatibility mode, the test program I 
supplied runs successfully in 1:12.

I am now using new drivers.  Focusing more on getting it right than on 
finding the smoking gun, especially if there turns out to be no gun.

I will now test the proprietary scripts

And the proprietary code runs in 37 seconds, even with $fa and $fs set.

Not sure if it was the drivers or the compatibility mode, but things are 
working great here now.

I hope that this helps someone else in the future

Thank you for all of your help!

items being compared:

item (a):  round heatsink model
item (b):  rectangular bar with lettering
item (c):  round heatsink backer with a 1/4-20 screw thread

in all cases, $fn was set to 360
item (b) uses write.scad,  which (*iirc*) i glommed off thingiverse
item (c) uses thread.scad, which (*iirc*) i glommed off thingiverse


on 2015.03.14:

item (a) renders in 15 seconds
item (b) renders in 33 seconds
item (c) did not render on first run (info @ end of email);
          i "tweaked" the scad and then it ran in 2 min 9 sec.


on 2014.03:

item (a) renders in 16 seconds (1 second  slower than 2015.03.14)
item (b) renders in 42 seconds (9 seconds slower than 2015.03.14)
item (c) renders in  4 minutes 11 seconds.

so, to summarize, 2015.03.14 is faster and perhaps a bit "touchier". 
the rulers are fab, and i'll be using 2015.03.14 from now on (unless 
something doesn't render...)

hth and THANK YOU ALL for this product!

Subject: [OpenSCAD] treatment of syntax errors in OpenSCAD
Message-ID: <CAJgOqAAJVHy5fi_zkE2c-BKkKfG-hTGMjobd=PkofmOp=mJOGg@mail.gmail.com>

I'm very much worried by the way OpenSCAD  treats what I call syntax errors:


square([2,3,]); //works like square([2,3]);


translate(1)circle();// translate() fails silently


square([10,10,10]); // fails silently



To remedy this I would like to initiate a discussion of what should be the
expected behavior, what should lead to an error, and what should lead to a
warning.


To facilitate this discussion, I wrote a small program that, as a test
case, lists all  possible values a variable could take on.

It than calls the module print_boolean() for all values which echos their
value and its Boolean value.

This program could then be used as a template for testing other calls (e.g.
sphere(value);).


Please have a look at it: Are there any other values that would be
important to include as test cases?

This has been discussed quite a bit. I agree that this needs a cleanup.
We could start with providing warnings for all such cases, with an option of treating warnings as errors, to give people some sort of bug compatibility.
Then there are corner cases..

Only the first one could be called a syntax error. Other languages allow
trailing comma for lists sometimes as it makes extending the list easier.

The rest are valid syntax but wrong argument type.

In my opinion, having ANYTHING fail silently is a real problem. This is 
one reason why people have trouble "getting into" OpenSCAD: no hints as 
to what they have done wrong.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] treatment of syntax errors in OpenSCAD

So in the case of Boolean value:

Is there any use case for the Boolean of a vector?
Could the attempt of getting the Boolean of a vector lead to a WARNING:
wrong argument type ?

That wouldn't be good for things like Vertices: 18420, which I use to
compare model differences and also any difference between OpenSCAD version.

+1 from my earlier learning experience, this was one of the most frustrating
bits.
However it should be a Warning (or an option) not a fail.
With the new alert at the view window it will stand out.

As this was just a quick-fix, it might break again next time you create an

I cleaned up my code a bit: organized the corner cases in a vector, so that
you can easily loop over them.

Presently the Boolean value of a vector is always (!) true.
Is taking the Boolean of a vector a wrong argument error (or warning) or is
there a use case anyone could think about?
Would it make sense to logical or all elements of the vector and use this
at its Boolean value?
What could one do with this?

Try this:

vec_empty=[];
print_boolean(vec_empty);

I get 'false'.

If a vector is not-empty it's not-false=true.

Can't reproduce the 2014.03/32 numbers:

        \ build   32bit   64bit
  release\

  2014.03         1m54s   1m30s
  2015.03         2m01s   1m37s

Which indicates there is a speed-up for this example, but not with
releases, but with build targets.

Anyway, nice release indeed!  In a lot of ways!

The Command Glossary in the OpenSCAD User Manual is totally outdated by now
(03.2015).
When OpenSCAD evolves the wiki gets updated, but the Command Glossary stays
unchanged.
The CheatSheet (http://www.openscad.org/cheatsheet/index.html) has taken
the function
of the Command Glossary and it does get updated regularly.
I propose that we will remove the Command Glossary completely and link to
the CheatSheet instead. Also I dont know how to do this technically.

This is a big deletion and I would like to discus this here with you first.

Removing the duplication is certainly a good thing.

The result is a bit strange though as the manual then links to the cheatsheet
which then in turn links back to the manual for details :-).

Is there maybe a way to put the data into the manual in some specifically
formatted way and just generate the cheatsheet from that (e.g. using the
XML export feature for that page)?

ciao,

I am not currently experienced with MacPorts as a developer, only a
user, so I wouldn't dream of stepping in front of someone more
qualified, but after next week, when I should be able to get into the
modern Mac era, I could step up to see what this takes.  I'm a
long-time Open Source developer and have been using OpenSCAD since
2010 or so.  I'm well acquainted with other Open Source management and
delivery mechanisms, so I don't anticipate too much trouble with
getting spun up on things.

If nobody steps forward in a week, I will.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] polyhedron question
Message-ID: <1426766746300-12085.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hello there,

There is one thing that's not clear to me about polyhedrons: 
Is it neccesary that all points of the polyhedron are unique? Such as in the
example in the manual? Or would it also work when each face of the example
uses its own points, which would mean several points would be double or even
trippled.
I'm asking this because sometimes it's easier for generation to create
points for each face seperately, instead of having to reuse (some of) the
points of other faces that have bounderies with the face you are creating.

I hope I made my question clear enough :)

thanks!

Bram

They don?t need to be unique, but they need to have the same ascii representation to ensure that they represent the same location in space.

Hey,

I am Shaina Sabarwal, one who worked on OpenSCAD GUI last year in
GSoC. This year I was thinking to work on Customizer feature
(currently implemented in meta-data-2) branch. For planning purposes I
need some use cases and examples on where can this feature be used and
as an openscad user what improvement or enhancement would you like to
see ?

You can have a gist of current implementation from following videos

Thanks.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] I made an alternative editor
Message-ID: <550BFA09.4060709@schaeffer.tk>

As a hobby project of mine in the last few weeks I made an alternative
editor for scad files. Its main goal is to allow for quicker model
building and to provide more context help. I made it to scratch my own
itch, but it is in a state that it might even be interesting for someone
else.

Especially if you are a terminal junky I think it can make you happy.
See attached file for a screenshot.

project and manual can be found here:
https://github.com/yschaeff/pscad

Its main features are:
- automatically write file so OpenSCAD can monitor for changes and
render live.
- One key document tree editing (eg press 'I' to encapsulate current
selection in 'intersection() {...})
- Copy/paste mechanism
- Undo/redo
- syntax highlighting
- formatting aid
- (limited) syntax checking
- Indentation as part of syntax
- tab completion
- VI inspired key combinations

future goals:
- provide default arguments for various statements.
- context help for arguments
- help screen

non-goals:
- Does not know about semantics (it can write silly scad files if you
ask it to, but they will always be syntactically correct)
- Does not mimic VI key combinations completely.

Hi,
the drag and drop thing seems very non-intuitive to me. Also it's
weird that you have to drag and drop it over the 3D canvas area. I
would prefer *Paste* button.

This looks cool.  Are the syntax and formatting rules accessible? Can 
the colors be changed easily?  Can this be integrated into OpenSCAD at 
some point, as was the other editor?

Syntax: Would you wish that? Is the scad syntax likely to change?

Formatting: well no. Not unless you know python. Though it'd be possible
to make certain things configurable. The only application I can think of
is different use of whitespace (indent width etc). Is that what you are
thinking of?

> Can

Yes, pscad.py:17 contains a palette.

palette = [
    ## selections
    ('edit', 'white,underline', ''),
    ('edit_select', 'white,underline', 'dark blue'),
    ('edit_suggest', 'brown,bold', 'dark blue'),
    ('error', 'white', 'dark red'),
    ('error_select', 'white', 'dark red'),
    ('select', 'white', 'dark blue'),
    ## misc
    ('status', 'white,standout', 'black'),
    ('bg', 'white', ''),
    ## text
    (COMMENT, 'dark cyan', ''),
    (MODIFIER, 'brown,bold', ''),
    ('var', 'white', ''),
    ('=', 'dark red', ''),
    ('(', 'dark red', ''),
    (')', 'dark red', ''),
    ('<', 'dark red', ''),
    ('>', 'dark red', ''),
    (SPACE, 'default', ''),
    ('stat', 'default', ''),
    (ARGUMENT, 'default', ''),
    ('path', 'default', ''),
    ('name', 'default,bold', ''),
    ('keyword', 'dark blue,bold', ''),
]

This would be relatively easy to get from a config file.

Sorry. I don't know. That was never my intention (and I suspect only a
niche will have interest for this style of interface?), I don't even
know what language OpenSCAD is written in. ;)

Thank you for your feedback!

I like to format things slightly different than anyone else, so I was 
curious about whether I could change things slightly.

Sounds like a fun and useful project!

I forgot to mention this project depends on the urwid python library.
You might need to install that. And thanks to Miro Hron?ok there is now
a setup.py script.

download latest release:
https://github.com/yschaeff/pscad/releases/latest (pscad-0.1.tar.gz)
unzip, untar, cd into directory
run "python setup.py install"

Hi, I'd suggest to have a look at the OpenSCAD source code, clone the git
repository and get it compiled. That's a good start for joining the project
and would be needed later anyway.

Also it would be nice if you can introduce yourself on our IRC channel
to chat about the project.

Some useful references are:

- The student guide giving an overview about GSoC in general
   http://en.flossmanuals.net/GSoCStudentGuide/

- The GSoC 2015 page in the BRL-CAD wiki
   http://brlcad.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/Project_Ideas
   This has some important links on procedure, communication channels
   and documents and also a checklist of things to do specific to the
   BRL-CAD/OpenSCAD participation


ciao,
   Torsten.

Just to comment on what's already there... it's basically prototyping
code for two use cases.

1) Define Parameters for a specific Model

    We have a simple keychain that needs some basic features to be
    configurable for other people to use, e.g.

    - The length, width and height of the keychain
    - The text to write on it
    - The diameter of the hole

    This is essentially what the Thingiverse customizer is doing

2) Define Parameters for Parts in a Library

    This refers to libraries like MCAD and maybe even more BOLTS. Right
    now, there is no UI support for using those. For example using
    a M4 bolt from BOLTS is:

    include <BOLTS/BOLTS.scad>
    ISO4014(key = "M4", l = 20);

    So you have to know what parameters are needed / possible. BOLTS
    has a very good documentation, but I think it would be even more
    user friendly if we can just add the include<>, start the compile
    and now a list of all library parts is available with included
    documentation for the parts and the parameters.

    Later we might even have that available via web with some kind of
    library index, but that's a different topic :-).

I'm sure there are more use cases and/or additional variations to the
two described above (e.g, saving parameter sets for the models from use
case 1).

ciao,
   Torsten.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] 3d offset
Message-ID: <1426891123168-12100.post@n5.nabble.com>

I just discovered the power of offset for 2d shapes. It can make the
development of designs with parameterised fits quite easy. Having the
equivalent functionality for 3d models would be extremely useful. You can do
some similar operations using minkowski with spheres, but performance
limitations mean you end up having to limit the complexity of the sphere
which in turn can affect the accuracy of the offset and can result in some
funny faceting.

Is a 3d version of offset planned? Im guessing this would be far less
computationally intensive than minkowski, so it would be far more useful in
designs. Could this perhaps be a GSoC project? I really have no idea of the
complexity.

Greg

Are you saying that 2014.03 works fine on exactly the same computer?
If so, I'd love if you could paste Help->Library Info for both versions of
OpenSCAD.

One of the great things about offset is that you can apply it in two
directions to smooth or fillet an object. 3d smoothing and filleting would
be one of the major advantages of a 3d offset() function.

I guess I should give the code example to show how easy it is to smooth and
fillet 2d shapes with offset():

Thank you for these great examples!

I had wondered how to do 2d filleting, and this appears to be the 
answer. Simply using offset() twice is a neat trick. Your example also 
illustrates the "children()" feature in a clean way, another bonus for 
me. Great stuff, I am going to use it. Thanks again.

Could you try these two things?
1) Run OpenSCAD on the command-line and paste the result: openscad --info
2) When OpenSCAD Crashes, check the Windows Event Log to get more info about
the crash, and post that here.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Beginner needs help with project
Message-ID: <1427029306380-12117.post@n5.nabble.com>

I am a complete beginner to Openscad ( started yesterday )
I have been reading tutorials and understand some of the ideas but still
have much to learn .
I am ok on things like primatives , and translations , difference , union
etc , and understand the reason for modules 
and I am guessing modules will be what I need for my project

I normally use Solidworks which I find easy enough to use and very powerful
however Openscad has one feature that Solidworks doesnt.
The abilty to use a file to make a design , but with the alteration of just
a few variables make a similar , but different copy of 
the item

The project I wish to make , but dont know quite how to go about it is a
simple box to hold a printed circuit board. That in itself I can do 
 but by changing a few variables I want to be able to make the box fit any
sized PCB that I choose rather than have to design a new box every time I
use a different sized PCB

I can assume various things about the box 


1) It will always have 4 bosses to screw the PCB down to and that those
bosses will always be 6mm high, 6mm outside diameter and have a 2.5mm hole
in the middle to 
   take a screw 

2) the Printed circuit board mounting holes will always be in a rectangular
pattern and will be  4 mm in from each edge of the board 
   ( the board will always be 8mm longer and wider than the bosses are
spaced at)

3) there will always be a 3mm gap between the edge of the board and the
inside edge of the box


>From those assumptions I should be able to input variables for 

The distance between mounting bosses in the X and Y directions 

The thickness of the box walls and floor

The height of the box 

and the code should then know enough to make a box that will fit a PCB of
that size   

Thats where I come to a stop, I dont know how to make it do that 
Can any one help please ?


Regards
Don

Whew, that's a question that is difficult to answer without just doing
the model and posting it :-).

Maybe start with creating just a cube() of the correct size based on
calculation using the variables you've described and add the drill
holes (simply though the whole cube).

Then post the code for that for discussing the next step.

ciao,
   Torsten.

Now, you posted an almost complete description of what you need.
Just extract all the variables-definition from that before you start coding.

Like this: ( // denotes this line to be a comment)

1) It will always have 4 bosses to screw the PCB down to and that those
bosses will always be 6mm high, 6mm outside diameter and have a 2.5mm hole
in the middle to
   take a screw

// boss
boss_height=6;
boss_diameter=6;
boss_hole=2,5;

Now do this for all your variables that you will need.

Next step:
Write modules for the single parts.
You may start again with the boss:

module boss(){

// now comes the real code, but I leave this for you.

}

Yes Openscad can do all this.

But...Solidworks can do just what you want 
too...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS6dhyvU-E

But you may well feel in control with openscad as you will be settin the 
parameters up yourself before hand, and building the model using them.

Openscad will do it at negligable cost, solidworks, well hmmm, i tried to
get a quote and they stopped talking to me when they realised i was not a
commercial company.

Hey there brother!   I too am an EE, and I just did this.

You are so very close.

Here's what I did:   I created a file using modules. A module for a test
point hole, a module for a screw post, a module for a PCB recess, and so
on.
In the end, I have an object which is built from differences and unions.

I will PM you those files, nothing proprietary there.  I think you'll find
them useful.

Ahh, nice example. I guess that's pretty much what we could do when saving
sets of model parameters along with the model itself.
A table view seems to be quite a useful thing, I hope it's not possible to
patent such a thing?

ciao,
   Torsten.

Thanks everyone for the replies, I can see a lot of useful stuff in there

I wasnt expecting so many replies so quickly so after the first one began
trying to write some code
which of course does not work

its not as neat or structured as some of the replies but I will try to get
better  now thay I have some tips from you 

I began setting out variables for the dimensions that the mounting holes are
placed at ,  the depth of the box  and the thickness of the walls, these are
the variables the user would change to suit their needs
 from these and the fixed constraints like the board is 3mm from the box 
and the holes 4mm in from the edge of the board I was able to calculate the
other variables

I made a module to create a cube the size of the outside  ... box_outer()
I made a module to create a cube the size of the inside    ... box_inner()
I made a module that takes the inner cube from the outer cube using
difference  ... box() 

but when I run it it tells me I have a recursion error , but I dont know why 

I will try and attach my code if I can find out how

Cheers for the help
Don

I suspect from the above that the afore mentioned log will be of no use. I
look at eventvwr.exe and found no mention of openscad.

I also suspect that this was not really a crash but exit with error.

You have the outer_box() module calling outer_box() as the last step,
and the same problem with inner_box() and box().

Leave off the code that calls the module inside itself and the
recursion error will go away.

Why don't you just go to  http://www.thingiverse.com
<http://www.thingiverse.com>   and do a search on "pcb box".  I got dozens
of hits, many with Openscad source code included.  Eg. 
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13979/#files
<http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13979/#files>  .  They may or may not be
exactly what you want but they offer great examples and can be used as
starting points for making other Things.

Hi again
            I removed the offending lines at the end of each module and the
error went away
but I still have 2 problems ,

The inner box should cut out the center of the outer one but it doesnt , I
can understand if it cut out but not centrally  because the corner of both
cubes have the same origin , the inner cube needs moving in the X,Y and Z by
the size of the boxes thickness ,  but its not cutting out at all and I dont
know why 

and in answer to  Michelle as to why not just go to thingiverse and download
a box? 
Well then I wouldnt learn anything  and that was the main object of the
excercise . If all I wanted was a box I can make one in a couple of minutes
in solid works but I was trying to learn to use Scad

Don

I wasn't suggesting you simply download and print an existing box.  I have
found that a great way to learn Openscad (or any programming language) is to
look at working examples of other peoples' code.  I've learned lots from
reading Openscad code posted on Thingiverse.  You said you were a beginner
so it wasn't clear if you knew about this resource or not.  That's all.

Hi
I found the answer to my own question , I had missed off the { and } from
the difference function in the last module 

all I need to do now is center the two boxes relative to each other and I
should be getting closer

Hi Michelle ,
  I didnt mean to sound ungrateful   , its just that pretty much most things
I saw on thingiverse
had only got an stl file  and no Scad file  but I can see now that if the
Scad file is available then looking at it should be very helpful

Don

For mine, I set the screw holes to the diameter used to drill for a tap.
The 6-32 screws self-tap into that very nicely.  The holes in the top of
the box then are the size to pass the screw. I found a table online
somewhere.

Lowering the number of sides in a hole can give nice hexagonal surfaces for
tapping into.

The one thing I didn't do (yet) on my test box that I would like, is to
have the bottom half nest into the top half.  But so far it has been ok to
just have the two walls meet without any indexing.

An example I have on thingiverse that is a nesting edge box for a pcb is
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:150101, here's the scad file link:
http://www.thingiverse.com/download:291446

The scad code is set up with lots of params to resize.  It's very basic
scad and an easy intro to boxen.

I'd be happy to help with any questions about it.

I am a relative beginner too, here is a first stab at something you can
start from:

module boss() {
  h = 6;
  r = 3;
  $fn = 20;

  difference() {
    cylinder(h=6, r=3, center=true);
    cylinder(h=7, r=2.5, center=true);
  }
}

module pcbbox(l=30, w=25, h=1) {
  co = 12;

  union() {
    difference() {
      cube([l+3, w+3, h+14], center=true);
      translate([0, 0, 3]) cube([l, w, h+15], center=true);
    }
    translate([(l-co)/2, (w-co)/2, 0]) boss();
    translate([-(l-co)/2, (w-co)/2, 0]) boss();
    translate([(l-co)/2, -(w-co)/2, 0]) boss();
    translate([-(l-co)/2, -(w-co)/2, 0]) boss();
  }
}

pcbbox(50, 40, 1);

Here is an advanced technique: you can `pass` a module to an other module:


module boss() {

h = 6;

r = 3;

$fn = 20;

 difference() {

cylinder(h=6, r=3, center=true);

cylinder(h=7, r=2.5, center=true);

}

}


module place_corner(x=20,y=10){

for(mx=[-1:1],my=[-1:1]){

mirror(mx*[1,0,0])

mirror(my*[0,1,0])

translate([x,y,0])

children();

}

}



place_corner(40,20)boss();

place_corner(40,20)cylinder(5,5,5);




?

Unfortunately my email program (googlemail) eats the tabs: find it with

P.S. Falls meine E-Mail k?rzer ausf?llt als Dir angenehm ist:
Ich probiere gerade aus kurze Antworten statt gar keine Antworten zu
schreiben.
Wenn Du gerne mehr lesen m?chtest, dann lass es mich bitte wissen.

P.S. In case my e-mail is shorter than you enjoy:
I am currently trying short replies instead of no replies at all.
Please let me know, if you like to read more.

Enjoy!

Once again thank you everyone 

Thanks to all the fantastic help I have been given I was able to find where
my syntax was going wrong  and have had a minor success

I can now generate the box , I still dont have the mounting bosses yet but
thats my next challenge

By inputing your values into the first 4 lines of my code it will now
generate the correct sized box while still maintaining my rules of 
the pcb holes are 4mm in from the edges of the PCB in both X and Y axis 
the PCB is 3 mm from the inside of the box on all edges  

I dont suppose its the most efficient or elegant way to do it but iot does
work
I did it like this......

// Enter your values into the first 4 lines below


holes_x = 140; // spacing of pcb mounting holes in X direction
holes_y = 100; // spacing of pcb mounting holes in Y direction
inner_depth = 35 ;// depth required inside not including the 6mm for the
bosses
thickness = 4; // thickness of walls and floor

// The code will calculate everything else it needs

inner_x = holes_x + 14; // inside width of box in X direction
inner_y = holes_y +14; // Inside length of box in Y direction
outer_x = inner_x + ( thickness * 2);// outside width of box in X direction
outer_y = inner_y + ( thickness * 2);//outside length of box in Y direction
outer_depth = (inner_depth+6+thickness);



module outer_box() {
    cube([ outer_x , outer_y, outer_depth]) ;
    
}

    module inner_box() {
    cube ([inner_x , inner_y, inner_depth]);
    
}
 module box() {
  difference (){
    outer_box();
    translate([thickness,thickness,(thickness + 6)])  inner_box();
}
}
box();

I need to scratch my head a bit now and think how I will add the bosses 

Don

Thanks for you efforts last year BTW, OpenSCAD is now a lot more user
friendly and starting to look professional.

Try using double quotes on the command line, works for me on Win7.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Crash while render surface with CGAL on 2015.3
Message-ID: <1427100765922-12148.post@n5.nabble.com>

1. I have a png file with the height map, 500x500 pixels.
2. I load this png as a surface.
3. I intersect or union or diff this surface with simple cylinder. 
4. I refresh the view in F5 mode and all is ok.
5. I press F6 button to create stl representation and my Openscad windows
process starts consume all memory until the computer crashes.

If I miss the 3 step and export the surface 'as is' than everything is all
right. 

Could you give me some advice, how to use the surface in my model?

I'd definitely welcome this. I can't recall how many times I've had to disable
all the fillet()[1] calls in my designs while iterating just to save some render
time.

I read somewhere that a simpler implementation of 3d offset without involving
minkowski could involve translating each face outward along its normal, trimming
off the intersecting bits somehow, and then filling in the gaps somehow.

Hmm, FreeCAD seems to have a working implementation of 3D offset. Does anyone
know more? Perhaps we could just port their algorithm into OpenSCAD.

Each of those quarter-million pixels produces at least half a dozen 
triangular faces, so that simple model might have a million surfaces, 
each with three vertexes. Each vertex requires a handful of floating 
point numbers, so ...

For my 3D printed cookie presses and chocolate molds, I set the image 
resolution to 4 pixel/mm for molds around 40 mm. The 17 March 2015 
version of OpenSCAD turns a 160x176 pixel image into an STL file in 
about 100 seconds.

If you reduce your height map to 250x250 pixels, it *might* start working...

Hmm, out of curiosity, why not the existing vi/emacs stuff? You seem like a vi
person, based on your mimicry of the vi keybindings, so
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3556 seems like a decent
alternative.

Well, yeah I _should_ have been a vi person. Though I never quite
gotten the hang of it.

I tried to make something to manipulate the document tree rather than
a plain text file. From the above link I gather it is merely syntax
highlighting? For me that is one of the least important goals tbh.

Main goals:
  - less typing
  - spend zero time on layout
  - have openscad generating a live preview
  - don't have to write ", center = True" all the fucking time

The rest is sugar coating.

Not to long ago I installed an app which was an android port for
OpenSCAD. I thought that was neat! So I could whip something up during
my commute. I quickly found out the interface was not adapted for a
mobile device and now I have to write code on this crappy on-screen
keyboard. I was so angry I almost tossed my phone out of the train.
This got me thinking what would be a better interface in general and
well, that may have sparked this project.

Thanks for the info.
I suspect that your GPU drivers are old. Could you try updating them and see
if that helps?
Intel is known for having low quality drivers, but they've been improving
lately.

Your polygons have wrong winding order. You can see this in Throwntogether

New test on Windows 7 machine:

It results in a syntax error.. Strange...

OpenSCAD testscript:

translate ([7*x[0],0,0]) { cylinder(h=5,r=5);
}
translate ([7*x[1],0,0]) {
    cylinder(h=5,r=5);
}

translate ([7*x[2],0,0]) {
    cylinder(h=5,r=5);
}

Command prompt and result:

C:\Program Files\OpenSCAD>OpenSCAD.com -o c:\temp\test.stl -D 'x=[123]'
c:\temp\
test1.scad
ERROR: Parser error in line 8: syntax error

Can't parse file 'c:\temp\test1.scad'!

Seems like you try to access 3 elements of a  array with only 1
element (123)...?

In your screenshot it looks like you're using "curly quotes" for the first
three of those single-quotes. The fourth one looks like a
straight-single-quote (ie: straight apostrophe). Since bash doesn't
recognize curly quotes as special characters, only the fourth quote is
treated as a quotation mark, and hence the end of your line is still
"inside quotes" from its point of view. That's why you get the weird
prompt: it wants you to close the string.

In short, avoid using curly-quotes in the shell/terminal.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] 2015.03 change in file open behaviour
Message-ID: <CAEEmnrMPzBJ-JqA2+-RSU_gT1x06uOO-UJkYa7b0J2rbOeK7Vw@mail.gmail.com>

In older versions if I open a file from the recent list and then use a File
- Open menu option the directory it looks in is the same as the file I
current have open. In 2015.03 it looks in the directory of the last file I
opened with File - Open. I.e. opening a file from the recent list does not
change the directory to where that file came from.

Is this an intentional change or a bug? I found it useful to open a file on
the recent list just to set the directory to where that came from before
opening the file I actually want.

The new (to me) MacBook arrived today, with 10.9 (Mavricks) on it.

I'm guessing that since nobody has said anything in the past 6 days
that nobody will break out in the next 24 hours, so I might as well
see what it's going to take to get a development environment on this
machine and get cracking.

Ha!  Surprise to me!  It's really got 10.10 (Yosemite) on it.  Speak

	comment
Message-ID: <1427217155138-12175.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi everyone, 

I've been using OpenSCAD for a month or two.  I think it is a fantastic tool
and I have great things in mind for it!

While I was playing around it occurred to me that I could use OpenSCAD to
wrap the large number of Actobotics parts available from Servo City to make
quite a nice library.  Along the way I (re)invented the connections concept,
seriously stubbed my mental toe on quaternion math, and ended up making
quite a few components, covering maybe 80% of the Actobotics range, a
handful of parts from other places and a couple of examples.

I've published this and some documentation at:

   https://github.com/davidthings/mocad

and would really appreciate questions, comments, and advice.

What I've done seems useful to me, but being a bit of a noob to OpenSCAD, my
biggest worry is that what I have done is completely stupid or redundant in
some serious way!

Specific questions I thought of:

- Does this project as a whole make sense?  

- Does the formalism of Part and PartPosition make sense?

- Is the naming OK? 

- Are there critical gaps in the documentation?  

- Could some of the internal math be more efficient?

My plan is to leave this for comment for a little while, then if all is
well, possibly expose it a bit to the Actobotics / Maker crowd to see what
they think.

I'm looking forward to hearing any reactions!

Message-ID: <CAJgOqAAJUxN1Bt-qMdbM-PzneaM7b1Mamjn74_ndzL5BDOBfTw@mail.gmail.com>

How to do it:

The lexer adds to every call of a primitive a token with a index number and
the line number of the editor. They act as a pseudo-color. When drawing the
preview (F5) a second (non-visibale) view is drawn, where every primitive
is drawn with its pseudo-color. Now, when you click on the model with the
mouse, simply look up the color under the pointer in the pseudo-view, and
decode the editor line number from it.
Now you could:
- jumb in the file to the selected line number
- open a new window with the parameter of that primitive and change them
right there

Yes! That would be useful, to tweak interactively.

I forget if it's an OpenGL GLU or GLUT API feature, but there's one (set) that lets you "tag" objects with an integer number. When a collision/mouse click is detected, the integer is returned.

It'll get moderately complicated when multiple files are involved via include, but not insurmountable.

<ircs://freenode/Bloodust,isnick>no but you can do this yourselfPete____how?
Bloodust <ircs://freenode/Bloodust,isnick>draw your scene to FBO and
dedicate one texture as 'id' textureBloodust
<ircs://freenode/Bloodust,isnick>then in fragment shader write the id to it

just said, do you?Pete____Im reading what a fbo is ...Bloodust
<ircs://freenode/Bloodust,isnick>framebuffer objectBloodust
<ircs://freenode/Bloodust,isnick>used when RTT AKA render to texturePete____So
I basically draw a second view that is colored with the id number?kyle1320
<ircs://freenode/kyle1320,isnick>Just checking, would it work to multiply a

a unique color, yesBloodust <ircs://freenode/Bloodust,isnick>Pete____
sillesta no you dont have to draw a second time/viewBloodust
<ircs://freenode/Bloodust,isnick>"normally" you would have a single RGBA

<ircs://freenode/sillesta,isnick>Bloodust: how would you separate different

would have another texture, possibly a single R8 or R16 texture that stores

<ircs://freenode/Bloodust,isnick>its very easy if you know how to use FBOs
Pete____I`ll have a look at the code (OpenSCAD) and see if I can find the
RGBA texture ...Bloodust <ircs://freenode/Bloodust,isnick>its possible your
code doesnt use an FBO especially if its older softwarePete____It does
color and alpha, so it propably needs to have it.Bloodust
<ircs://freenode/Bloodust,isnick>nope, doesnt need itPete____Ok, I?ll have
a look. Thanks for your help!

cut and paste didnt work that great:

draw your scene to FBO and dedicate one texture as 'id' texture

then in fragment shader write the id to it

"normally" you would have a single RGBA texture attached to your FBO to
save color

and in this case you would have another texture, possibly a single R8 or
R16 texture that stores the object ID

That looks like the modern way of doing it.
The question is: What is the minimum version of OpenGL we should require?
What you describe above is available only on OpenGL 3-class hardware.
OpenGL 2 extensions for this exists, depending on drivers and hardware capability, see e.g. https://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/framebuffer_object.txt

For OpenGL <=2, there is glSelectBuffer, which offers something similar, see e.g. https://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/framebuffer_object.txt

I think you had a copy-paste error there? You posted the same link twice.

Here's a page with some info about the "classic" way of picking/selecting
in OpenGL:

Would this mean that you could only select positive objects? Wouldn't we also want to manipulate negative objects (I.e parts difference()ed from others?). Also, which object would be selected when hovering over the result of an intersection()?

All negative objects are rendered as well, so this is mostly a UI issue in terms of how to guide selection.

Hi David,

Nice work! I'm working on the MCAD library (at the moment getting myself up
to speed, exploring some concepts). One thing that would be very helpful for
openSCAD users is a standard library of existing parts, such as this. Many
websites like mcmaster.com have iges/stl/solidworks files available - not so
much scad. It's unfortunate because scad files are perfect for
generative/enumerative catalog parts. Having scad files on vendor websites
would also be a great way to promote the platform.

I look forward to checking out mocad and am interested in discussing
organization and extension of libraries like this with you.

Mitch

Hi David,

At first glance this looks really awesome!
One of the things we hope to facilitate with OpenSCAD in the future is support for user-contributed libraries, through some sort of online repository, as well as officially supporting or endorsing a style for describing connectors.

We?re also (or rather, hyperair is) working on modernizing the MCAD library. I?m not sure how such libraries would be shipped in the future, but either merging or breaking up such libraries, using said online repository, would make sense.

Cheers,

 -Marius

Nice work Shaina! I also want to thank you for your contributions to the
interface last year. It's very nice and I look forward to your next
contribution.

I'm looking to contribute to the MCAD library this summer. I think the
standard parts library would be much more useful if it were integrated with
a customizer-like interface. We should collaborate. I am especially
interested in the abstraction and association of key parameters.

I have a ton of ideas for how this might work but I'm not sure they're ready
for the world. I was hoping there would be a bigger response to your post -
something to set the tone/expectations. Is this forum where that discussion
should be, or are there threads on github? If not, let's figure out a good
way to plan this out. (mockups, narratives, polls, etc?)

I apologize if this discussion concern is a solved problem, or if I'm doing
it wrong. I'm new to the community and I think this aspect of the project is
very important.

Thanks!
Mitch

Hi,
This year, I am proposing to work to improve QScintilla Editor of
OpenSCAD by writing custom lexer for SCAD language and solving various
scintilla and GUI related issues.
Here is my proposal

I wish we could, but I have moved to other project for this summer, as
the Customizer of the OpenSCAD is at its first step and it requires
more discussions before implementing new features. That's what
understood by talking to mentors.

Just make sure you don't limit 'material' handling for future
multi-material/colour production.
Sounds like additional id's can be used tho, so probably OK?

It would also be really good to be able to drag (with a modifier key or
maybe middle button) a discrete object and have the translate() modified.
Maybe rotate too?? But that is maybe to trad-CAD...

Yes, it would probably possible to forward the work on this but with the
discussions needed, the timeline is hard to set. Also it's unlikely to
get to a state that could go into a release after the 3 month of GSoC
project. Having things merged is no requirement for GSoC results but I
think the chance of getting the work merged is a nice additional
motivation.

So while it's not an ideal GSoC project, we still can get the discussion
going. Especially regarding libraries it would be nice to collect things
that would make usage much more user friendly than just "use <library.scad>".

ciao,
   Torsten.

They are the keyword highlight and autocomplete I use with  Notepad++

scintilla)

They should have the 2015.03 new keywords, but I haven't done a double check
since the official release. 

I'll do that in a little while and put an official 2015.03 version on
thingiverse for others who use NP++.

Yes, that's related to GUI, the proposal has two parts - scad lexer
and improving GUI.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Animation flicker
Message-ID: <1427258985808-12199.post@n5.nabble.com>

Since the last major release (or soon before it) I'm pretty sure Animation
has changed for the worse.

Currently on Mac and Linux (nightly and release) animation flickers quite
considerably more than it used to.  I don't think that it's running any
slower, I think, perhaps, the screen is being cleared a bit too early?

I just went back to version 2013.01+dfsg-2.2 and although most of my code
didn't  run, (children() spoil everything) what did show up was smooth and
flicker free.  Back on the current release, showing only that which
displayed on the old version, the display still flickered.

It's a bummer, because animation was rocking my world.

I have some pretty crappy video that shows the problem on my machine. 

https://www.dropbox.com/s/47yvwiv123408z9/os_flicker.MOV?dl=0
<https://www.dropbox.com/s/47yvwiv123408z9/os_flicker.MOV?dl=0>  

The video starts and ends at full speed with a slo-mo section in the middle. 
I hope this helps.  I'd really like flicker free animation back!

Noticed the same thing, seems like it's clearing the window when it starts rendering the new frame rather than waiting until it's ready to display. Lowering framerate leaves the image up longer, making it more usable, but it's not a good solution.

I noticed this as well some time back on a new version. Exact version number
unknown, but I did wind up returning to the old version I downloaded over a
year ago because the animation was more useable!

The backup feature just saved my rear this morning.  Thank you for adding
this feature.

I made a copy/paste error that put a call to a module inside its own module;
this was not intended to be a recursive function and had no way of escape...

OpenSCAD gave "Recursion detected" a few times and locked up hard.... and I
am sitting in front of an hour's code that I have been tinkering with and
forgot to save....

Backups FTW!

Message-ID: <CAJgOqACvOhnxiYk2dEkT9DwSyX4y2piQdbJ4rfx9_Wuyk8YM2g@mail.gmail.com>

Why is the upper sphere not smaller?

$fn=32;


r=2;

o=1;


module sphereo(r=1){

sphere(r+o);

%cube(2*(r),true);

}


{sphereo(r);echo(o);}


translate([0,0,8])

assign(o=-o){sphereo(r);echo(o);}



The output is:

ECHO: 1

ECHO: -1


So the assign works for echo but not for the module call???



?

Variables use lexical scoping. If you don?t pass the o variable, or accept it in the sphereo module, it will lookup o from the scope in which the module is defined (global scope).

Now this works:
Still, this is confusing to me!

$fn=32;


r=2;

o=1;


module sphereo(r=1,o=0){

sphere(r+o);

%cube(2*(r),true);

}


{sphereo(r,o);echo(o);}


translate([0,0,8])

assign(o=-o){sphereo(r,0);echo(o);}

It?s probably confusing because you pass the value 0 (zero) instead of the variable o.

Now, there is a cool thing you could do with the new QScintilla lexer:

pass the text of comments (and strings) to the (google) spell checker.

Like in ChatZilla: When you type in the chat window it underlines wrong
words in red and right-clicking on it brings up corrections.

Unfortunately one can not assign values through to children.
Or, do you see a way to do that?

$fn=32;


r=2;

o=1;


module sphereo(r=1,o=0){

sphere(r+o);

%cube(2*(r),true);

}


{sphereo(r,o);echo(o);}


translate([0,0,8])

Kind(){sphereo(r,o);echo(o);}


module Kind(){

assign(o=-o)children();

}



Output:

ECHO: 1

ECHO: 1

The only way to do it is with a $ variable as they have dynamic scope so
can be set in a parent and accessed in a child in same way as $fn works.

Thanks, nop. Now it works:

$fn=32;


r=2;

$o=1;


module sphereo(r=1,o=0){

sphere(r+o);

// %cube(2*(r),true);

%sphere(r);

}


{sphereo(r,$o);echo($o);}


translate([0,0,8])

Kind(){sphereo(r,$o);echo($o);}


module Kind(){

assign($o=-$o)children();

}


Output:

ECHO: 1

ECHO: -1



?

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Improving the findreplace dialog window
Message-ID: <CAJgOqACi_VUBQ4YuzScPTUqsVNNSObEPntEe3zV5zty4QWe6DA@mail.gmail.com>

Would the following be possible:

After entering something into the find-field a TAB should jump to the
replace-field.
This would streamline the work flow. Now a TAB jumps to <, which is not the
next thing I want to do.

When on the replace button, a move-curser-left jumps to the replace-field.
It should jump to the < button. When on the replace button, a
move-curser-right should jumb to the > botton.
This would allow replacing a string and jumping over following string
without replacing easy to do with the key board.

Did I explain this, so that it is understandable?

I think it would make sense to go to the Replace-field in case you want to
change it.

Better would be to make the < & > hotkeys, say ctr-shift-< & ctrl-shift-> 
then you don't have to go to the button and press enter or click. And
similarly for the find dialogue.

If it's being redesigned, I'd also suggest:
replace the DONE button with a GUI close box,
replace the Find/Replace drop-down with one click radio buttons, &
probably icon-ify the buttons?.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] SVG Export
Message-ID: <1427340601159-12216.post@n5.nabble.com>

Firstly, thanks for implementing SVG export.  It works much better than DXF
export for things like a laser cutter.  DXF files import a circle as a group
of lines, each of which is cut by the laser.  If doing multiple passes, the
cutter does each line segment n times, then moves onto the next segment. 
The SVG version cuts the complete circle before cutting the next pass.  This
reduces a lot of whiplash on the laser or cutting head.

Here is my slight problem.  OpenSCAD is unitless, but de facto standard is
that the units are in millimeters.  An STL file (also unitless) that I make
in OpenSCAD with "cube(10)" pulls up on every single slicing program I have
tried as a 10mm cube.  When OpenSCAD makes a SVG file, it does not put any
units in for the dimensions.

In Inkscape, which I use for my vector editing, Inkscape defaults to px as
the default unit if no unit is given.  This means that anything I try to cut
from OpenSCAD is much smaller than it needs to be.  I can fix this in the
.SVG file itself by changing this line in the file thusly:

<svg width="216" height="280"  ....> to <svg width="216mm" height="280mm" 
....>

According to the SVG standards at:
http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/types.html#DataTypeLength
the datatype "length" used in the length and width descriptors of an SVG
file can be just a number, or a number plus a unit (10, 10mm, 10cm, 10in,
etc.)  Could it be an option to set the units of an SVG file so that we
don't need to edit the file first?  I personally would have no problem if
the default SVG units for the width and height were set to mm, since that is
the defacto standard for 3D models, it would make sense to be that way for
2D models as well.

Thoughts?

Subject: [OpenSCAD] text() 2D or 3D?
Message-ID: <1427341825296-12217.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi all,

Hope this is an OK place to post this. 

I'm loving the addition of the text() module but I'm a little confused as
far as the documentation goes. On this page of the documentation it looks
like text() should be generating 2D outlines for extrusion
(http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Text). 

But when I preview text in in OpenSCAD on my Mac it appears to be extruded
(by 1mm). It this the intended functionality?

Oh, I think I know this one. In "F5" it looks like the text has a
thickness, but if you press "F6" it should be shown how it really is, as a
2D object.

In F5 (preview mode), all 2D shapes have a 1mm thickness just for preview
purposes.  In F6, 2D elements have no thickness.

linear_extrude(10) text("Hello");

makes an extruded text.

Ah, yeah rendering does render as pictured in the documentation.

Is this a limitation of the preview render? It seems a little confusing to
have it render two different ways.

Yes, it was a design choice some time ago and has been the topic of some
discussion re the confusion it can generate. There have been proposals to
make it something like 0.001 thick. Pending.

Yes the Save As dialogue seems to use the directory the currently open file
came from but it doesn't alter a subsequent file open dialogue. That seems
to remember its own idea of the current directory.

Forcing the units to mm where OpenSCAD has none could then just break
things for other people (strangely the Inkscape on my system seems to
default to mm when importing unit-less files).

I think the most useful option is https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/649
which would allow to specify properties for the export. This would help
not only SVG but other formats too.

Why not have a option in prefferences for "default SVG output units" that
defaults to "none".

Then everybody can be happy happy shiney.

Something that seems like a bug is that if you scale a 2d shape with just a single argument it scales in z too.

But perform some 2d operation on it (like offset() and it returns back to 1mm thick.

The default unit in Inkscape  can be changed via the /Document 
Properties/ dialog
(File ? Document Properties... (**Shift*+*Ctrl*+*D**))

Three things for your review:
1. Draft proposal
2. Rough project notes
3. Customizer concept demo

1. I have a draft GSoC application up and welcome feedback. You can see it
here:
https://github.com/mitchdraft/scaddergories/wiki/Draft-GSoC-2015-Application

2. I have a very rough outline of some of the things the standard library
project will include in the Readme of what will be the working directory
here:
https://github.com/mitchdraft/scaddergories

3. I think the standard library will be most useful if developed alongside a
customizer-like interface. I have a demo of an early experimental GUI
prototype which is part of my master's research. This will help to inform my
development of the standard library. You can check out a video here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiY9SCviUyg&list=PLxsFfCmwjpYzLGdtEqEz2kOl2svx-7uc0


I'll be submitting tonight, pardon the short notice. I welcome your feedback
on all of the above.

Thanks,
Mitch

I know that the units can be changed in Inkscape; but this doesn't
retroactively apply.

1) Make drawing in OpenSCAD 200 wide , save as .SVG
2) Open file in Inkscape 0.91, comes in as 200 px wide   (60 mm)
3) If I change the default units in Document Properties, it doesn't change
the file that was just imported, it changes the rulers; instead of being 200
px wide, it is now 60 mm wide.

I just tried changing the default.svg to have a default unit of mm but it
still opens up unitless files as px.

A drop-down on SVG Export that remembers the last setting would be nice.

could we make the openScad default editor work like gedit?  imo gedit is 
the most popular de-facto linux editor.  vi/vim/nano are fine, but are 
more command-line oriented; gedit is more "non-tech friendly".

while ctrl-f is the modal find key combination, ctrl-h is the modal 
find/replace key combination.  ("modal" as in "most frequently 
occuring", imho.)  i'm not against ctrl-alt-f, but for long-term users 
of command lines and editors, it's neither typical nor intuitive.

also, anytime esc is hit during a find or a find/replace, the dialog 
should disappear, and the cursor should be left where it is.

try gedit and see.  just my $0.02!

Presumably that's because there's a setting somewhere that says there are
3.33 pixels per mm?  <desperate hope> is it possible to change that to 1
pixel per mm?</desperate hope>.

Stand firm for what you believe in, until and unless logic and experience
prove you wrong.  Remember: when the emperor looks naked, the emperor *is*
naked, the truth and a lie are not "sort-of the same thing" and there is

Based on http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Units_In_Inkscape it
sounds like 1px = 1/96in in SVG, as in CSS.

It is possible to change the default unit in Inkscape and get it to
"stick", by creating a new document, changing the document properties, and
then saving over the default.svg file (on Linux it seems to be located in
~/.config/inkscape/templates/). This only affects new documents, though. I
tried doing this, and then loading an OpenSCAD-exported-SVG into Inkscape,
and it still comes up as using px.

Having per-file-type export options makes a lot of sense to me, as you're
bound to run into situations where you have to lose/add some information in
the export process and there is no "one right way" to do that. Inkscape and
GIMP both have option dialogs for exporting: https://imgur.com/a/g0pXW

GIMP displays the options dialogs after the file chooser, as it uses the
file chooser itself to select the file type. The options available depend
on the file type, and are sticky. Inkscape instead has a (dockable)
modeless dialog -- pretty much a tool palette -- that handles exporting,
and has a button to make the file chooser appear.

Personally, I think the approach GIMP uses is easier to understand, and I'd
guess that it'd also be the easier one to implement in OpenSCAD.

Hi!

With the proposal deadline already in sight, I have some general comments
regarding the procedure first...

* Please have a look at http://brlcad.org/wiki/Summer_of_Code/Checklist with
BRL-CAD as umbrella organization for our GSoC participation, the checklist
does apply for our projects too (e.g. Application Format).

* As GSoC requires the project to be mainly about coding, I think it would
be good to clarify which steps of the proposal will involve writing code.

* Make sure you also submit *something* to the melange site. It's even
suggested to post some outline or even just the link to the Wiki as early
as possible and just edit later. Without that, it will not be possible
to accept the proposal in melange (and GSoC deadlines are strict).


ciao,
   Torsten.

Notepad++ (Windows) also uses Ctrl-F & H respectively, so +1 for me.

But, there is a need to do a holistic review of the keys and menu structure
as outlined a while ago  here
<http://forum.openscad.org/The-recent-talk-on-Accessibility-had-me-look-at-menus-td7320.html#a9399> 
. See also  here
<https://github.com/openscad/openscad/wiki/Keyboard-Shortcuts>  .

The view menu in particular is getting way to big to allow easy/relevant
shortcut mnemonics, and somehow has to be split. imho.

Also some keyboard control for the preview window for Accessibility users or
keyboard fiends.

Can you guys look at tne php composer tool, its a good example of a remote
dependancy management tool; it allows getting of libray dependancies from
various sources including github and other sources. It would allow authors
to declare lists of libary components that are required to process a model.

I can definitely verify this issue in the most recent release of OpenSCAD. It
looks like double-buffering has been disabled for the 3D viewport. This
hampers use of the animation system to test inverse kinematics equations for
CNC machine designs (e.g. for my slightly non-standard delta printer
designs).

Yes, I don't think SVG is compatible with unit less dimensions. Without
explicit units It defaults to px, so isn't really compatible with OpenScad
and STLs unit less philosophy.  I think units need to be added when the
file is exported and they should default to mm but be configurable.

For Mendel90 I wrote a Python DXF to SVG convertor and that specifies mm in
the SVG to make it work in InkScape.

Try the following:

1) Use openscad.com instead of openscad.exe
2) Don't use the --render option - that's used for rendering to STL. If you
don't want an STL file, omitting this option is quicker and more robust.

..and make sure to use OpenSCAD-2015.03, not an old version.

 -Marius

In a graduate CAD class I prototyped a method for automatically positioning
components in an assembly using a simulated annealing algorithm. To do this
I created a simple voxel-based solid modeling environment in Matlab. You
can see a demo here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0L1OKj12I4>. (If I
were to do it again, I would have used OpenSCAD + improved coding skills
and gotten a bit further!).

Unfortunately your link (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0L1OKj12I4) is
not assessable from Germany, because of:
 Unfortunately, this video is not available in your country because it
could contain music from UMG, for which we could not agree on conditions of
use with GEMA.
One reason to use open-source music.  ;(

Schade und ironisch, you'll miss my German language pun, the song was

What you want should work on the cmd-line:
$ openscad myfile.scad -o myfile.png

myfile.scad:
import("myfile.stl");

Both myfile.scad and myfile.stl must be in the same folder.
If that doesn't work, please post the STL somewhere.

what i would like to see would be a full-width view of the code - either 
the top half or bottom half of the window, user selectable in 
"Preferences" - and the log output and preview windows side-by-side, 
either above (in the case of the code on the bottom half) or below (in 
the case of the code on the top half) of the window.

i tend to use labels instead of numbers for values, with the labels 
equated to the numbers in an included file.  that way i can do basic 
xref's to see "who references what", and if i want to change the size of 
an item, i change the equate in the included file.  the way openscad's 
layout is now, the code looks real "choppy" because i insert carriage 
returns to avoid horizontal scrolling (using the moose aggravates my 
tendonitis).  yes, i've tried trackballs/trackpads, ugh.

as i'm not coding on this project, i'm just asking nicely...  pretty 
please with sugar on top!

I think that exact order is not possible, but you can drag around
the windows or even undock them (if that's enabled in Preferences).
The possible combinations are pretty much set by the Qt GUI Framework.

Yes my Carpal Tunnel get aggravated when I try to move the Moose too, he

So you would need to have multiple files open to edit the project I assume.
Have you seen  this
<https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Using_an_external_Editor_with_OpenSCAD> 
? Whenever I do something non-trivial I use Notepad++ and have the preview
and console showing & editor window hidden. That way you can have whatever
layout you want.

Also, old versions used to cache more data, so once every frame had been compiled once, it could be displayed more quickly and smoothly the next time around until something changed. Recent versions don't seem to do this.

i'm having an issue getting the console window next to the preview/view 
("P/V") window.  i'm on 2015.03.14.nightly.  the issue has to do with 
moving/resizing a given window element (P/V, console, editor).

is there a way to specify which window will appear where in some config 
file?  i could edit it and get the setup i'm looking for...

thanks
yvette

The possible arrangements are limited by the way we use Qt. The
view window is basically the center and it's possible to arrange
the other windows around it.

Like http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwidgets-mainwindows-mainwindow-example.html
where the white area would be the view window.

How is it supposed to look like?

Technically yes, but I don't think it will be possible to edit it
manually (Qt stores some unreadable binary blob as window state)
and I'd expect it to allow only the combinations that are possible
to get with drag&drop in the GUI too.

ciao,
   Torsten.

i'd like:

the view    window to occupy the upper left-hand corner,
the console window to occupy the upper right-hand corner, and
the editor  window to occupy the entire bottom half (full width).

thanks for letting me know!  i'll keep attempting to finagle it into the 
style i'd like.

Right, this is not possible with the current settings, as this
would not have allowed to maintain the old style after switching
from a fixed layout to sub-windows.

Interestingly after some playing around with the window state
state settings, it might be possible force the wanted layout.
It seems the state settings from the config file totally
overwrite what we are setting in code, so the values in code
have only effect if there is no config file at all (e.g. after
new installation).

So there is one thing we could try...
- find a compatible system and run a modified OpenSCAD that
   allows the different layout
- copy the blob into the config file
- cross fingers the hacking works :-)

What OS are you using?

On my Debian/64-bit system, I'm getting:

- Config file:

$HOME/.config/OpenSCAD/OpenSCAD.conf

ok, i copied the .conf file you specified and renamed it, to save the 
original values.  first time thru, it didn't work; then i realized i had 
the wrong .conf file.  locate'd the right .conf file, added your 
changes, and ... see attached pic.

Voila!  You Da Man!

Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS 64bit.
