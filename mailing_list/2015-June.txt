OpenSCAD is a bit picky about the .dxf files it supports.

Can you share the dxf you are trying to load?

Hi Basile,

Thanks for your reply. The file attached is one hat I downloaded from the 8020 website. I do not know how it was generated.

Other that the fact that it has a bit more rough edges on the curves I can
see nothing wrong.

After exporting it as svg from QCAD, importing it into Inkscape, ungrouping,
deleting the blue lines, merging all the paths as one, flattening beziers
with 0.1 and exporting again as dxf all I got better was a little better
curves. (That's apart the fact that the object generated from my dxf was not
centered and smaller than the original)

BTW Importing the original dxf I got the same 2 warnings.

Message-ID: <556ECA84.30400@creative.chaos.de>

Hi,

yesterday I released the 1st pages. If you want to join in, look here
for further details:

http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?247,517022

If you want to translate it into other languages - feel free to ask me.
My knowledge isn't good enough to translate it myself.

During the writing, I recognized that the original documentation isn't
of much help for a beginner. A short example:

Cylinders, cones, pyramids and prisms are basically all cylinders. But
the documentation doesn't care much about it. Try a search for pyramid
or prism - there are no results at all.

In my script, a cylinder isn't the same as a cone. I separate the both.
As well as with pyramids and prisms. They all are different things for me.

I think if one 'keyword' is able to do 4 different things then it has to
be explained in 4 parts.

My script starts with a hand full facts and primitives and there are 5
easy tasks (step pyramid, traffic cone, game pawn) to solve for the
attendees. If they send me their solutions I'll answer after a week or
so. I expect discussions about my and their solutions. We'll see. After
that the next part will be released.

Every part does things more and more the elegant way. There are tasks
within tasks such as "Build a Cheops Pyramid at a scale of 1:1000. Use
the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the right diameter to get the right
side length."

Building hex nuts (later with threads) with chamfered the edges, working
with circular segments ... up to building a 1.77m x 1.12m x 0.80m rack
of aluminium extruded profiles and generating a BOM.

That's so far for the 1st 12 pages.

Stefan

Hi Basile,
Thank you for looking at it. I can live with the warning since the extrusion works fine.
I was just wondering if some parts of DXF were not processed by OpenSCAD.

When I have some spare time, I will look at the code doing the dxf import.

Best regards,

Currently a handcrafted importer is used
(https://github.com/openscad/openscad/blob/master/src/dxfdata.cc)
which does not support a number of entities found in DXF files.

The plan is to select an existing library and use that for import
and export of DXF files.
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/wiki/Project%3A-Improve-DXF-import-and-export

As far as I know, nobody is currently working on this, so ideas,
pointers to more libs to select from or any other help would be
very welcome :-).

ciao,
   Torsten.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] rotate around a "virtual axis"
Message-ID: <CA+P+bncadZd9RmNjuRe0st=7+mwYq2=DbuD+THRa9Z-9S6_hBg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,
I'm trying without much success to create something that looks like this:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:282868

To be more specific the goal is to create an empty sphere where the surface
has hexagonal-shaped holes (arranged like a bee nest).

I've tried many approaches, the one I think could be the best is the
following:
1. cut an hexagon
2. for ( k = [0 : 60 : 360] ) rotate([offset_deg,0,k]) cut hexagon
3. recursively repeat for each of the six hexagon using as z-axis the line
connecting the center of the sphere to the current hexagon.

I was not able to implement that solution since as far as I now it's not
possible to rotate around a "virtual axis"

That's another possible (buggy) implementation (it takes around 1 min to
render):
https://gist.github.com/Emanuele-Spatola/17680d59f173bbc78d79

Any help would be really appreciated!

Thanks,
Emanuele

Rotation is around the origin and around the XYZ axes. To rotate around an
arbitrary axis you need to rotate and translate your object to line up the
arbitrary axis with the origin and say X. Then rotate around X and then do
the opposite rotation and translation to put your axis back where it was.

Message-ID: <CAFeuZ2U7NH8xgF6cF8=-EHziOci0cUp0ZpbPQtjW7adbgnuR1A@mail.gmail.com>

I would like a series of cubes to appear alternately either side of
the y axis. Here's what I have:

for(i = [0: 0.1: 1])
{
    x_offset = i*10%2==0 ? 0 : -3;
    echo(i);
    echo(x_offset);
    translate([x_offset,0,50*i])
        cube([3,3,1]);
}

Imagine the 50 is the length of a bigger structure and I want these
little cubes to appear along that length. So I multiply by 10 and then
modulo 2 to see if it is even. If it is even, leave it where it is,
otherwise translate it so that it is on the other side of the axis.

All goes well until 0.8, where the ternary operator suddenly decides
that (0.8*10)%2 is not zero. If you run this separately the modulo
operator does seem to return zero.

I'd appreciate any thoughts.

Ian

0.8 is an irrational number in binary floating point so it is not
surprising it doesn't exactly equal an integer when multiplied by 10.

I had a feeling there might be floating point reason. I've made it
work by counting from 1 to 10 instead and then dividing by 10
elsewhere.

Thanks!

If you mean to rotate around an arbitrarily oriented axis, it is 
certainly possible. What you need to do is to create a function 
returning a 4x4 homogenous transformation matrix specifying your 
rotation. Its input would be a vector defining the rotation axis and 
also the rotation angle. The result value is applied to the model using 
"multmatrix".

I was about to suggest:

for( i = [0:10] )
{
   x_offset = i % 2 ==0 ? 0 : -3;
   echo(str(i, ? - ?, x_offset));
   translate([x_offset, 0, 5 * i])
       cube([3, 3, 1]);
}

No need to divide by 10... just don't multiply by 10... try this (untested)

for(i = [0: 1: 10])
{
    x_offset = i%2==0 ? 0 : -3;
    echo(i);
    echo(x_offset);
    translate([x_offset,0, 5*i])
        cube([3,3,1]);
}

After almost a day of failed attempts and research, I found out what I
wanted to create is not physically possible :)
or at least it's not possible just with hexagons, you need to put some
pentagons in the middle.
The name of the polyhedron is Geodesic Sphere dual:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_dome#Chord_factors

the design is not as straightforward as I thought, I found a couple of
.scad sources:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:345775
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:65820
but they are not parametric.

Also turned out openJsC <http://openjscad.org/#examples/sphere.jscad>AD has
a geodesic sphere built in:
https://plus.google.com/+ReneKMueller/posts/5hp2CcMRJqu

So now I'm playing with the geodesic sphere source code trying to make what
I need:
http://openjscad.org/#examples/geodesic-sphere.jscad

Thanks to everybody who helped!!

Emanuele,

Here's another thing that has the hexagons and pentagons calculated: 
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:334955

That thing (and most of the others I've seen) "cheat" in the sense that 
they don't actually do face sub-division, which is a bit tricky to 
implement in the OpenSCAD language.

I've created a gist, 
https://gist.github.com/Yona-Appletree/a03bc32a5c5ca6886e38 with my 
implementation of geodesic slicing. The geodesic_example.scad file 
contains an example of using the library. You'll have to excuse the 
quality of the code... I was just learning OpenSCAD and geodesic math at 
the time, so it's kind of funky, but it does work correctly, as far as I 
know.

Best,

Yona

Subject: [OpenSCAD] triangulation of a multi point, non planar faces polygon
Message-ID: <1433510697788-12793.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi
I use a polyhedron to create an object like this;

polyhedron(points = points_3Dvec,
		faces =my_faces);

In my_faces there is a multipoint face like so [23,3,4,5,6,7,44,66].
My math says its planar, but OpenScad (or CGAL or someone else) thinks it is
not. To be honest, I rotate the thing.

In short, is it possible to triangulate the thing?  The texts on Wikipedia
looked like a lot of work.
Perhaps someone has code for that?
Thanks for any tips
BenZ

What's the actual issue? And what version of OpenSCAD is it about?

Possible yes. One option could be to find a file format that supports polygons
(I think OBJ supports that) and try some tools to convert to STL or AMF that
do only support triangles and extract the points/faces again.
Not sure if that helps though, as most programs will use floating point
calculations which are not always matching what math says.

ciao,
   Torsten.

The issue is, that I must close a hole on a complex polyhedron. The opening
has the described multipoint face [23,3,4,5,6,7,44,66] (a.k. the
hole...insert dramatic sound). So i need a function to insert the multipoint
face and as a result something like this appears : [[23,3,4],[3,4,5],....]

OpenScad version 2015.04.25, git 2b33922

Good idea, why overkill, I could precalculate it and hardcode it! Face
Sometimes discussing helps.
Well of course an algorithm would be more professional...anyone else?

You may be interested in Goldberg Polyhedra. Basically, the generalised form
of the soccer ball. Based on what I've seen in youtube videos, someone must
have parametrised them.

@Hypher: I tried running your code in the response, but it's dependent on a
"platonic.scad" I either don't have or am not pointed to by default (please
excuse if this is a newbie mistake.)

You will need all the files in that gist, not just the example file. Use 
git clone https://gist.github.com/a03bc32a5c5ca6886e38.git 
geodesic_example to grab them all.

Here's a screenshot of what it looks like, for reference:

Yona, your design is great!! Thank for sharing it.
I was trying to understand the code, but I have to say I'm quite lost :(
I'd need it to look like this: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:79337
My idea is for each triangular face, create a pyramid with base the
triangle itself (a bit smaller) and as top the center of the polyhedron.
then subtract all this pyramid from the main polyhedron.
The problem is I have no idea where to start, any suggestion? :)

Thanks,
Emanuele

I'm a little confused here. Isn't the point of the multipe precison
libraries MPIR/GMP/MPFR to prevent 0.8 becoming irrational en use an
internal representation like  (8/10) to represent 0.8  ?

Emanuele,

There's a really fantastic polyhedron set for OpenSCAD available here: 
http://kitwallace.co.uk/3d/solid-index.xq

They render like this: 
https://www.dropbox.com/s/881dv9jy8l9e2pg/Screenshot%202015-06-05%2013.39.22.png?dl=0
I updated that gist to include an example of how to this -- just run git 
pull to grab the new nice_rendering.scad file.

The logic used to generate those is pretty complex, but it's fairly easy 
to swap in a new polyhedron. The result looks like this: 
https://www.dropbox.com/s/xi0dxp9wjlammj7/Screenshot%202015-06-05%2013.44.12.png?dl=0

If you want just pentagons and hexagons, you can just use the truncated 
icosahedron provided here: 
http://kitwallace.co.uk/3d/solid-to-scad.xq?id=TruncatedIcosahedron&scad=shell
Which looks like this: 
https://www.dropbox.com/s/ooa88h6y0v4meao/Screenshot%202015-06-05%2013.47.18.png?dl=0

Cheers,

Rational numbers are very slow compared to floating point. They also take
up a lot of memory, especially if you do long chains of multiply/divides,
which causes the denominators to get increasingly bigger.

The OpenSCAD language uses floating point to represent numbers (which is
good, for speed). But then it uses CGAL for rendering, which involves
translating those floats into rational numbers. CGAL is incredibly slow,
and one significant reason is the use of rational numbers.

In the long term, I expect OpenSCAD will replace CGAL with a floating point
geometry kernel, and then it will become much faster and use less memory,
which will make it possible to build more complex models than what are
currently feasible. Of course, to do this we'll need to find and use
techniques to deal with the imprecision that accumulates during a chain of
floating point operations. But the advantages of faster operation and the
ability to model more complex objects will make this approach compelling.

It would also be possible to change the OpenSCAD language to use rational
numbers, but this is less helpful than it might first appear. This might
address some of the problems recently raised in the forum, such as Ian
Gibbs' issue with the % operator. But there's another current issue with
rotating a polygonal face and having it become non-planar. Unfortunately,
certain common operations, like rotation, involve trigonometric functions
whose results are irrational, so rational numbers don't help. If the
language used rationals, it would still have to convert back to float to
handle sqrt and trig.

Thanks. Completely misunderstood on my end; I thought gist was basically
pastebin + versioning. The page actually has a button to download the lot,
but I mistook it as an offer of software.

 Code's rendering well, but I'm getting some vertices numbered twice?

Thanks Yona, the "nice_rendering.scad" works perfectly!
The truncated icosahedron has a limited number of faces, I need something
more flexible like the "Goldberg Polyhedra".
I think the code would not change much as in the currently generated
polyhedron the pentagon and hexagon are already there, we just need to
remove some edges.. (said like that it is seems easy :)
I'm already printing it:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/fkh63u84h6vll9g/Screen%20Shot%202015-06-06%20at%2001.49.09.png?dl=0
but in the meantime I'll try to look into your code to see if I can make it
like I need.
I'm working on a rolling ball robot and I still have a lot of other pieces
to design.

Thanks a lot!!

Emanuele

I'd like to see a screenshot of that for reference. It's probably a bug 
in how I'm de-duping the vertices... I'm basically computing all the 
faces separately, then using a function to find the unique vertex 
locations. It's possible that a floating-point equality issue or other 
bug is causing some of the vertices to be repeated. It wasn't a 
requirement for my original use of the code for the vertices to be 
unique, so I didn't really check that.

Glad to hear it, Emanuele!

I'm glad someone else is getting use out of my geodesic calculations in 
OpenSCAD. I was surprised not to find another implementation, and 
writing it was a bit of a pain, so I'm happy to save others the pain of 
that recursion hell :)

Let me know if there's anything specific you'd like it to do, and I can 
try and point you in the right direction or make the changes myself, if 
they're simple.

Best,

Yona

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Importing DXF as lines
Message-ID: <1433559943222-12807.post@n5.nabble.com>

Why does this DXF file import with alternating solid and hollow parts? I just
want it to import the lines, which I will then offset to give them some
width.

If only enclosed shapes are possible and it is impossible to import lines,
is there a way I can edit the DXF so that it imports the shape I want?

32 bit XP SP3, 1GB of RAM, latest download from the web site.  It installed
fine but when I run it, it thinks about it for a while and then puts up a
pop-up with "openscad.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close.  We
are sorry for the inconvenience".

However, an older version of Openscad (2011.12.30) works OK but gives a
message about OpenCSG being disabled.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] A faces( ) function for simple polyhedrons
Message-ID: <1433579464351-12809.post@n5.nabble.com>

Just released a *faces.scad* that can generate faces for simple polyhedrons: 
https://github.com/runsun/faces.scad/blob/master/faces.scad.
<https://github.com/runsun/faces.scad/blob/master/faces.scad>  

This is part of a lib that I am working on. During my course of learning
polyhedron, the faces is the most frustrating obstacle. So I think that I'd
make my face() a stand-alone lib so this might help people like me. 

This lib currently only supports 5 very basic polyhedrons. And it use
4-point faces. I do hope that, in the future, openscad will consider having
a better faces() as the builtin. 

The function api: 

> faces( shape  // cubesides|rod|chain|ring|tube     , nside  // # of sides    
> , nseg   // # of segments for chain     )

Its currently-supported 5 shapes are demonstrated below. The points, *pts*
are given in the example files in the release. The construction of those
*pts* is beyond the scope of this work. 

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n12809/demo_cubesides.png> 	
&nbsp;&nbsp;cubesides
&nbsp;&nbsp;Needed for building other shape faces.

> f=faces( "cubesides", nside=4 );polyhedron( points=pts, faces=f );

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n12809/demo_rod.png> 	
&nbsp;&nbsp;rod
&nbsp;&nbsp;Same as a cylinder

> polyhedron( points=pts, faces=faces( "rod", nside=4 ));polyhedron(
> points=pts , faces=faces( "rod", nside=6 ));

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n12809/demo_tube.png> 	
&nbsp;&nbsp;tube


> f=faces( "tube", nside=20 );polyhedron( points= pts , faces=f );

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n12809/demo_chain.png> 	
&nbsp;&nbsp;chain


> f=faces( "chain", nside=4, nseg=5 );polyhedron( points=pts, faces=f );

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n12809/demo_ring.png> 	
&nbsp;&nbsp;ring
&nbsp;&nbsp;A ring is like a closed chain.

> f=faces( "ring", nside=4, nseg=10 );polyhedron( points=pts, faces= f );

There is no such thing as a line in Openscad. Only closed 2D and 3D shapes.

Hi runsun,

Nice utilities.
I downloaded your file faces.scad, and tested it with the latest mac OS X version.
The preview work fine, but the rendering fails when trying to render the ring.
This happen using showall();

when loading, the console looks like below:

I believe the error is trying to render two or more separate objects. 

Try do this:

module showall(){
    cubesides_faces("olive");
    rod_faces1("olive");
}    

and it still gives you the same rendering error.

Render them one at a time will be ok.

I downloaded something from Thingiverse, and wanted to import it into
OpenSCAD, and it won't import.

I looked at the documentation, and I couldn't find anything saying that
importing binary STL files wasn't possible.

Would this be a bug, or it just doesn't work?

Message-ID: <1433646876409-12814.post@n5.nabble.com>

I have a latest gen macbook pro and imac both with discrete graphics cards
but openscad realtime performance is very slow compared to a 6 year old
system running linux.  I tried using openscad 18 months ago and the
performance was bad then too.

Is there any plan to look at improving graphics performance in the future
for Mac?

Really looking forward to using this tool.

I use OpenSCAD on a macbook pro too. The problem is that openscad does not seem to be using more than one processor.
The load is only max 108% of one processor at the worst when rendering, or previewing a complex design.
So it does not get all the benefits of the OS X machine.

I still like it and use it on my current projects.

Can you share the model you are trying to render ? Or does this problem occur
with all models ?

Please define "rational numbers" in terms of CGAL. This sounds like some 
none-native object replacing C++ double. If that is so, no wonder 
OpenSCAD takes forever to complete computing slightly non-trival models, 
using insane amounts of memory.

I have recently created an OpenSCAD model that was somewhat non-trivial, 
although quite small compared to models I used to work with 10+ years 
ago, using a commercial library (ACIS). I managed to complete my 
OpenSCAD model, but it was painfully slow and I will not attempt 
anything larger as things stand.

Perhaps the argument for "rational numbers" in CGAL is some illusion of 
infinite precision. The fact that you may end up with non-manifold STL 
files anyway, shows it really isn't worth it. In ACIS the stated 
precision was 1E-6 using ordinary doubles, and we had success using it 
(of course there were numerical problems at times). 1E-6  means one 
millionth of a millimeter if the model units is in mm. For 3d printing 
purposes it is sufficient.

I have a long term goal of revisiting OpenCascade, but it will take time 
to do so. It is 20 years since I (briefly) looked at it.

Is it possible to use CGAL with only native double variables, avoiding 
"rational numbers" entirely? If yes, this would be an interesting short 
term thing to try and see if it would speed things up. If no, then a 
replacement such as OpenCascade might become a desired goal sooner.

How? What happens? How did you import exactly? What OpenSCAD version
is it?

Is there a difference when using F5 vs. F6?

The import handles both binary and ascii STL's.

Without further information, I'd say the file is broken. There's a
small chance it might be a bug, but to check that, the actual file
is needed.

Rational numbers in OpenSCAD :
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Building_OpenSCAD_from_Sources#CGAL_and_GMPQ

I was slightly surprised to find rational numbers used as well, it does
explain the speed and size requirements which had always puzzled me. CGAL
offers different kernels, I don't know how much work is required to change
to a native floating point kernel.

I am just looking at changing the backend code in OpenScad to support
colors etc, I had planned to adapt the Nef polyhedra but now I am wondering
if it would be better to start with a different backend.

Last time I looked at OpenCascade I was unable to build it, I had trouble
getting the demo to run. Hopefully the community edition OCE is now more
polished.

I think that's 2 very different issues...

1) The OpenGL rendering is slow (e.g. rotating the 3d model in the viewport)

    This has a short explanation in:
    https://github.com/openscad/openscad/wiki/Project%3A-Improve-OpenGL-rendering

2) Multi-threaded rendering

    https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/391

Both would be very nice to have, but as far as I'm aware, nobody is currently
working on this. I did some prototyping for the OpenGL topic, but this also
showed we will have quite a big cross platform issue there.

ciao,
   Torsten.

This would be a great way discourage / deprecate the nasty $fs=6 i've seen
in models where hexagons are created by degrading the quality of cylinders.

imho $fa, $fs and $fn should only be user to control the rendering
resolution of quality.

Thanks for the reply torsten.
I'm only refering to Open GL.
Open GL works fine in Linux for me, the Open GL performance is so bad in 
osx that I can't use a simple model of a 3D printer, I can't really use 
it.  I wish I could help develop with you guys but I need to keep 
focus.  Bummer that its so hard to fix, but for me this is a 
blocker/deal breaker and has remained since I first tried Open SCAD in 
the begginning of 2014.  I hope it gets the attention it deserves, you 
guys have a great program here.

That isn't actually in the manual. How can we fix the manual ? Is it in
github ?

It's on wikibooks: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual

Actually from user perspective I don't see much need to explain this,
OpenSCAD is supposed to import STL files. How those are generated or
internally structured should not matter and users should not need to
care.
I guess the error handling could be improved a lot, especially the
fact that most import errors are only shown once and then "cached" is
not very user friendly. I think there's already an issue on github
for that...
But if you have a good idea how to explain the details, it's easy to
add to the wiki based manual.

ciao,
   Torsten.

Have you got auto reload and preview on? If it is then it is worth trying
it without as that makes a huge difference from me on Windows if the
project has got lots of files.

We increased some rendering limits in recent versions. If you go to "Preferences->Advanced->Turn off rendering at NNN elements", you can try reducing that number and see if it improves.

Can you please check which version of Qt is used in the Linux version?
(Help -> Libraray Info)

Qt changed something in Qt5 which causes a huge slowdown (probably dependent
on the graphics driver) as it's waiting for the vblank.
We tried to disable that behavior but that does not seem to work always.

Another thing that causes considerable slowdown is the DEBUG flag, so
in case this is not running the release version, maybe give the release
build a try.

ciao,
   Torsten.

Could you share that design?

Immediate mode OpenGL is indeed a fair bit slower in OS X than on other systems, due to internal implementation differences.
Rewriting the rendering code is the only real way of fixing this.

It?s possible to hack around this, it would just be infinitely preferable to use a real framework for rendering.

The issue is not so much the actual values, but the algorithms go
unstable. E.g. if the algorithm needs to decide if a point is left
or right of a line and totally fails when getting the wrong answer,
it's essentially useless when using floating point.

It would be interesting to get some information about other options.
For some additional pointers/libs, see
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/wiki/Project%3A-Survey-of-CSG-algorithms

I'm not sure a huge thing like OpenCascade is the right way to go.
A big question would be how to get issues solved that involve the
CSG kernel. Right now my impression is that it's quite hard to do
with CGAL. Of cause that's not easy to find out...

I think CGAL does need exact predicates to work for the CSG stuff
(currently Exact_predicates_inexact_constructions_kernel is used).

Hyperair, the PPA manager, says:

Yeah, the PPA only has Ubuntu packages, but nicodemus is trying to extract
packages for Debian ("testing" in the 404 path means Debian Testing).

I don't think there's support in Launchpad for Debian PPAs yet, but on the
other
hand, I have Debian upload rights. Let me talk to Christian and see if he'll
mind me doing a non-maintainer upload (NMU).

That said, the NMU process takes a while, so perhaps I could leave some debs
around for nicodemus to use if it's urgent.

I never even get to that point.  That error pops up before any Openscad

This sort of crash may happen if your OpenGL drivers are buggy.
Could you try running OpenSCAD on the cmd-line as shown below and paste the
output here, alternatively upgrade your OpenGL drivers?
Sometimes, inspecting the Windows Event Log help diagnose this too.

$ openscad --info

OCE is what I would check first, indeed.

I agree it must be easy to build for it to become a viable alternative.

I would try the following

"OCE sanity check"
Goal: figure out if the library is maintained and usable
0. Check any license restrictions
1. Check whether API documentation is understandable
2. Check that it builds
3. Check that any test examples work and give expected results

"OCE prototype"
Goal: Understand the basics of OCE use, with CSG in mind
4. Figure out how to construct cylinders, spheres etc.
5. Figure out how to do boolean operations with OCE

Assuming the above is successful, it is then possible to use the 
knowledge to implement a CSG backend based on OCE.

In my mind, the interface of such a backend would be 100% independent of 
OCE and there should even be competing implementations of the same 
interface based on CGAL, OCE, ... etc.

Back in the day, I created a similar backend using ACIS. Our goal was 
not CSG, but the application code never saw ACIS directly and that 
turned out to be a good design decision then.

Good point.  It's an S3 Graphics ProSavage DDR.  I checked and there does
seem to be an update available.  I'll try installing that and see if that
helps.  Thanks.

A fundamental requirement is that boolean operations must be quite 
stable, I agree. There may be several ways to achieve such stability.

I browsed the list and did a very quick and subjective assessment of the 
libraries found there, looking at C++ implementations only:

cork:      mesh based, No activity the last 2 years
carve:     mesh based, activity one year ago, has some documents (old)
OCE:       geometry/topology based, latest update March 2015, big
csgtool:   mesh based, Updated 9 months ago
csgjs-cpp: mesh based, No activity the last 2 years

In essence the list contains some "smallish" and poorly maintained (?) 
libraries that are mesh based and there is OpenCascade (as represented 
by OCE). Perhaps there are other candidates.

To me, the only contender in this list with a solid foundation appears 
to be OCE, but again it wasn't a thorough review.

I agree OpenCascade is huge. That is one reason it needs to be 
encapsulated with a much simpler CSG-oriented front end call interface 
to make it usable in something like OpenSCAD. It will require some 
study, but I suspect it is doable over some time. The upside is that you 
get a professional geometry/topology backend that is maintained.

Ok, I take that to mean one either use CGAL as now or replace it.

Yep, that's one of the reasons why this is not an easy decision.

Well, the question is if that's actually an upside or not. It might
be, but I've seen a number of cases where an open source project
is just some 3rd level of customer, mostly ignored by the main
project people. With the smaller projects it's easier to find out
what the actual state is and there is the option to resurrect those.
Anyway, it's probably also a good idea to have a better look around,
e.g. at BRL-CAD where we have good connections or maybe see if the
Antimony kernel could be used.

There might be some options to improve the CGAL usage, but it's
certainly not just easy as some things were tried in the past,
but resulted in other problems (I don't know the details, there's
something in to forum about that).

ciao,

It's one big reason yes. However CGAL has some very specific requirement
about number behaviour. You don't *have* to use rationals. If you look
back through the threads you'll find a discussion some time back about
switching to either 64:64 or 32:32 fixed point.

CGAL lets you play with your maths system but doing so involves a mix of
C++ gunk and maths so I've never gotten to the point of implementing the
fixed point methods.

Not usefully. They don't really have the right properties. The binary STL
file format is a disaster area in general (not just openscad) due to this
and requires you use dictionaries and either clean the mesh or tweak it
in order to get valid STL.

I've had also had problems with moderately complex models that have
unacceptably long rendering times.

Rationale numbers aren't the only problem. Things get much faster if you
don't union a large number of little pieces together.

I am in favour of changing OpenSCAD so that implicit unions are suppressed
in most cases. I think most slicers do not mind if your STL file contains
overlapping objects. I would suppress the top level implicit union by
default, and add an option to "Export as STL" to perform a union. I
typically want to render my object many times during development before I
am ready to create an STL, and I'd like those non-final renders to be
faster.

I am running version: version 2015.04.21 (git 167b882)

on osx yosemite (10.10.3)

I downloaded the STL files from this:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:798225/#files

Of, course Jp1.stl loaded ok. It is ascii
None of the rest of them did.

Both Meshlab and Blender loaded them fine.

I updated the S3 graphics driver to the latest verison I could find - 
13.94.33 WHQL, which is still admittedly only 3/26/06.  But it didn't help. 
Running openscad.exe again gave the same error message - "openscad.exe has
encountered a problem and needs to close".

Michele,
Rename the scad file to a different name before starting OpenSCAD. Then it might start OK.
I had this problem with an mistake that I did and saved. The only way to restart OpenSCAD
without crashing was to do what I suggested earlier.

Good luck,
Jean-Paul

Thanks, but it crashes when simply double-clicking the icon to start the

happening very early in the execution.

I downloaded Jp2.stl (binary)

I imported it OK. It is way off center, use the View-All button to find it.

I assume the same issue with the others.

Both preview (F5) and final rendering (F6) became essentially unusable 
for my case on a reasonably fast Win7 machine. Every move or rotate took 
many seconds to complete in F5 mode, and with F6 I had time to make a 
cup of coffee. After completing F6, rotate was fast. These things are 
related to how OpenGL is used I think.

If boolean operations are slow, it might help using them less .... for a 
while. However, the main issue is why they are slow. The "rational 
number" feature is probably a major cause, but there might be other 
problems too. Essentially, if the implementation is O(n?) or worse, 
reducing the number of unions used will not make a big difference in the 
long run. You really need an efficient back end for boolean operations, 
something like O(n*log n).

I do agree it would be good to have a faster preview, however it is 
done.

That may well be true, but if you fixe the underlying maths to be fixed
point 32:32 or similar then you'd be arguing about tiny fractions of the
time taken now and it really wouldn't matter either way.

hi,

i design all my stuff in OpenSCAD, and i now need to apply for patents.

the patent drawings have stymied me somewhat:  i'm loathe to have to learn
yet another gui, like FreeCAD, and i thought, "hey, i've already got the

but DWF files are not an export option on OpenSCAD.  no worries, Marius, i'm
*not* asking for yet another feature of OpenSCAD; i'm just trying to create
drawings!

so does anyone know a method / process / script that can create DWF files
from OpenSCAD?

if not, may i ask, what drawing / CAD programs do others use for patent
drawings?  (NB:  i have absolutely NO artistic talent.)

i appreciate all input, and thanks in advance!

I ran a simple benchmark on union(). It is a bit slower than O(n), but much
faster than O(n^2). So it's probably O(n*log n) for some log base. The time
complexity may be model dependent, and my test had a simple structure.

Anyway, if this time complexity result for union holds true in most cases,
then probably the rationals are the bigger performance problem.

On my underpowered Windows machine, with the latest release,
* a single sphere(10) rendered in 0s
* two overlapping sphere(10)s rendered in 5s
* 10 overlapping sphere(10)s in 58s
* 100 overlapping sphere(10)s in 951s

I assume DWF would represent some sort of 2D projection of your design.
I would also think that given a DXF file, you could generate DWF using some external tool.
..so if you could reduce the problem into exporting DXF, you should be home free.

Perhaps playing around with projection() in OpenSCAD could create decent 2D objects which could be exported as DXF?

This has been a problem for my customers and me, too.

I have changed the Projection to be Orthogonal and viewed from Top and 
Left etc with some success.

I've also exported the STL, imported into SketchUp (free), shown that as 
Orthogonal, and then attached dimensions to the drawings.

Getting decent support for this in OpenSCAD would be very helpful, and 
would "announce" that this is a serious tool for designers

Not sure if it helps, but the DXF files OpenSCAD produces can be fed 
through another program to create a DWG.  The one I use is A9CAD 
(Windows freeware), it is a simple CAD program that can go between DWG 
and DXF.  Open DXF in A9CAD, Annotate if needed, Save as DWG.

The only disadvantage is that everything is a polyline, no actual circles.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Errors using projection () w/ imported terrain2stl files
Message-ID: <90AC43F2-CF32-475F-8054-1B41CA556E6B@frycomm.com>

Working on a project and am getting errors trying to get shaped based for islands using:

http://jthatch.com/terrain2stl/

The files import okay, but I keep getting errors trying to project the landmass into a flat area which I can then extrude so as to make a thicker base.

Suggestions? Is there some other tool I should use?

OpenSCAD has allowed me to do projects that would be more difficult with
other tools. Thanks for making this possible.

You can always minkowski around an infinitesimally thin cylinder to make a
disc. Applying minkowski with a sphere will produce the rounded disc you
describe. If you subtract a cylinder of smaller radius from the disc to make
a thin ring before applying minkowski then you'll get a toroid.

Minkowski is very computationally expensive so you'll probably soon find it
too slow for it to be useful in more complex models - there are often
quicker ways of achieving a similar result.

Interesting..
This kind of touches on the difference between surface material and internal material. If if was possible to capture that in the design, such designs could be easier to create.

Some examples.

A color test piece from RepRapPro.
https://github.com/bobc/csg_tool/blob/master/samples/various/original/simple-test.scad
The model is built by differencing components to create non-overlapping
volumes. With new semantics, this becomes unnecessary. The simplified
version is
https://github.com/bobc/csg_tool/blob/master/samples/various/simple-test.scad

The union() operator acts more like "append". This also means that the
operator is now non-commutative, which may be a problem. Internally, a
union() can create >1 objects as a result, if the internal properties are to
be maintained.

Output for files for VRML, STL, and AMF are at
https://github.com/bobc/csg_tool/tree/master/samples/various

Truncated cube from thingiverse : http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19168. I
had to modify the code slightly to fix some inside out polyhedra. The
modified source and output files are in the above github repo.

Tests with slicers.

I loaded up the files (STL and AMF) into a few slicers to check for
compatibility. (I didn't try any printing yet). KissSlicer only handles STL.
Slic3er and Cura can read AMF, as well as STL. They all loaded OK, but the
CSG library I am using does not produce a good output mesh.

Summary 

- Handling of multi-color models does not require extra syntax in the
language, although it would be useful
- the semantics of CSG union () operator changes significantly
- to retain color properties through CSG ops requires a new internal
representation of objects. 
- there is a straightforward mapping from internal objects to STL or AMF
files for 3D printing.

Message-ID: <1434210885275-12868.post@n5.nabble.com>

AMF does not have a defined "density" property for volumes, although it has
an "elastic modulus" property which could be similar. A user defined
metadata attribute could be used to specify fill/density, this would be
non-standard. Slic3r are already using non-standard attributes in the AMF
files they generate; I suspect we might need different export profiles for
specific programs. Messy, unless some general agreement can be made.

I have been wondering on how to introduce new properties in OpenSCAD
language. I think color() is a precedent, it effectively tags child geometry
with the color attribute. So a new keyword like "meta()" or "property()"
could be used to keep it generic and minimise impact on the namespace.
Therefore to specify something like density, syntax like

property (name="density", value=1) {...}

or perhaps

property (density = 1) {...}

could be used.  Similar syntax could be used to specify DXF layers etc.

Generation of "modifier" meshes could then performed from the overall model
if required.

I think meta data should not be part of the model description itself.
As always there is a gray area like the current use of color() which
is not part of the final model, but used in preview context.

But especially things tied to a specific output format might make
more sense to have a clear distinction from the object tree making
up the model, but could attached to the nodes.

This is similar to the discussion about having meta data for
variables (e.g. for customizer) or modules (e.g. for part libraries).
See https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/722#issuecomment-69521189
for examples of those.

ciao,
   Torsten.

The point is we want properties like color etc to be in the final model, so
your assumption is incorrect.

I really don't see how your GUI based parameter customizer idea has any
application here. It only works if the parameters being adjusted are
actually part of the model.

For the CSG operators to handle properties correctly, the properties must
be in the CSG tree. Fiddling solely with the AST tree doesn't help at all,
because the CSG backend doesn't see that. Your customizer is nice, but
doesn't help with the underlying problem.

Ok, wrong words then. Of cause they are in the AST but may not end
up in the exported 3d-model (e.g. when using STL). Using the modifier
mesh example from slic3r to define an area with different fill

root-node
|
+-union-node <- assuming lazy union, so it's just logical grouping
   |
   +--cylinder-node
   |
   +--parameter-node (having the fill information)
      |
      +--cube-node (the modifier mesh)

Attaching meta data to the node itself

root-node
|
+-union-node <- assuming lazy union, so it's just logical grouping
   |
   +--cylinder-node
   |
   +--cube-node <- attach meta data here / used by the export

Attaching multiple meta information values to a single node is
pretty natural. When fitting this into the normal tree representation
that will create:

root-node
|
+-meta1-node
   |
   +-meta2-node
     |
     +-meta3-node
       |
       +-cube

which makes handling the tree much more awkward.

Similar logic could be applied to other things, e.g. for 2D/DXF
(https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/1044)

Ignore the GUI part, I'm just talking about the language part
which defines a way to attach meta data to different things of
the model/script.

This is awesome, Bob.
Thanks for working on this.
Looking forward to eventually using it to print multi-material objects.

That sounds more like Young's Modulus
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young%27s_modulus

If so, it isn't the same as density.

Message-ID: <557CCC6E.5010703@jonbondy.com>

I can get this to work with F5, but not with F6: it just hangs for 
hours, running full CPU.  Any thoughts?


rch = 0.1;
ballDiam = 25.4 * 1/4 + rch;
$fn = 50;

module spiral() {
     myScale = 1/40;
     hubR = 5;
     for (d = [0:1:720]) {
         hull(){
             rotate([0, 0, d])
                 translate([hubR + d * myScale, 0, 0])
                     sphere(d = ballDiam);
             rotate([0, 0, d])
                 translate([hubR + (d+1) * myScale, 0, 0])
                     sphere(d = ballDiam);

             }
         }

     };

difference() {
     translate([0, 0, -ballDiam * 0.7])
         cylinder(h=ballDiam, r=28);
     spiral();
     }

$fn = 50;
for (d = [0:1:720]) hull()

I think it will just take a very long time or consume all of the memory
because CGAL hates the massive implicit union of objects with lots of
vertices. It simply doesn't scale to high detail models. If you can
construct it with functions that generate lists to feed into polyhedron it
will be much faster.

See the work kitwallace did with knots. A spiral is not too different.

I've been programming for over 40 years.  Most of OpenSCAD is 
more-or-less intuitive to me.  But "functions that generate lists to 
feed into polyhedron" leaves me dazed.  Just like list comprehensions: 
wonderful magic, but magic just the same.

Thanks

List comprehensions aren't a new thing though:

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Error on Linux when installing openscad-nightly
Message-ID: <1434268123184-12879.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi, 
I've installed Linux Mint on my second laptop, and I'm trying to install
openscad-nightly on it.

I've run
wget -qO - http://files.openscad.org/OBS-Repository-Key.pub | sudo apt-key
add -

and then added 

deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/t-paul/xUbuntu_15.04/ ./

to sources. Linux Mint is based on both Debian and Ubuntu, so I guess that
should be the correct one to use.

But when I do 'sudo apt-get install openscad-nightly' I get this error, and
I don't know how to solve it;

---
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 openscad-nightly : Depends: libstdc++6 (>= 4.9) but 4.8.2-19ubuntu1 is to
be installed

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Building OpenSCAD without CGAL
Message-ID: <1434270087261-12880.post@n5.nabble.com>

I have set up a Linux build environment for OpenSCAD, and can successfully
build out of the box.

I'm now looking at unplugging CGAL, in order to try different backend. 

I see the code uses "#ifdef ENABLE_CGAL" in several places. I naively tried
commenting "CONFIG += cgal" in openscad.pro, but this gives build errors.
Inspection shows files like GeometryEvaluator.cc refer to CGAL without any
guards.

Perhaps this is a build option that used to work and has decayed, or maybe I
am doing something wrong, but I couldn't find any mention in build guides or
google searches.

Any tips?

I found and modified kit wallace's knot code (which is based on some of 
your code).  Once I understood that the function at the top controlled 
the entire object, it was indeed simple.  That is, the two of you made 
it simple for me!  Not sure how to eliminate the requirement that the 
tube be closed, though.

This means the nightly build version which is about to be installed
needs some newer libs.

According to http://www.linuxmint.com/oldreleases.php the latest Mint version
is based on Ubuntu Trusty which is 14.04, so maybe try this one instead:

   http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/t-paul/xUbuntu_14.04/


ciao,
   Torsten.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Building OpenSCAD without CGAL
In-Reply-To: <1434270087261-12880.post@n5.nabble.com>
References: <1434270087261-12880.post@n5.nabble.com>
Message-ID: <1434287523963-12885.post@n5.nabble.com>

I decided that GeometryEvaluator.cc is CGAL specific and should be in the
cgal {} group. I created a stub version to act as a placeholder for CSG API.

There are several places where CGAL dependency has an impact, notably
mainwin.cc and the OpenCSG preview. The preview requires CGAL to evaluate
some geometry OpenCSG can't handle.

After a bit of hacking, I got it to build and run, the GUI doesn't do
anything but the command line runs ok and can generate a CSG file.

There are also some miscellaneous dependencies, e.g. OFF import. I think
there is no problem using parts of CGAL where useful, and replacing the CSG
part, but the separation between openscad and CGAL is less clean than I had
hoped.

I'm not sure how preview/render modes are best done with alternative CSG
backends, it would be nice if the OpenCSG preview was self-contained.
Ideally I think the CSG engine and GUI would be independent.

For the moment I will continue with my hacked version, but longer term some
refactoring to create a cleaner interface will be needed. This could be done
independently of developing alternative prototype CSG implementations, if
anyone is interested? :)

Unfortunately F6 fails on my system but it works in 2 minutes if I remove
the spheres at the end points.

Looks like a bug in OpenScad triggered by unioning nearly coincident faces.

Actually it was caused by the winding order of one of the end caps being
wrong. This fixes it: -

function cap(facets, segment = 0, i = 0) = i < facets ? concat(segment ?
facets * segment + i : facets - 1 - i, cap(facets, segment, i + 1)) : [];

Also the sphere facets can be aligned with the tube by adding a rotation:

    translate(path_points[0])
        rotate([0, 180 / $fn, 0]) sphere(ballDiam / 2);

Actually the rotation is only needed when $fn is a multiple of 4. It lines
up without when $fn is a multiple of 2 and not at all if it is odd.

I have an idea to explore a CSG implementation based on OpenCascade, but 
I must admit it is nothing but an idea at this stage. I have looked at 
some code samples which looked interesting, but I have not gone further. 
I am hoping to spend a few days this summer to figure some of the basics.

A clean interface between OpenSCAD and a CSG implementation will 
certainly make it easier to offer alternatives to using CGAL.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Redirect of the console output
Message-ID: <1434304886840-12893.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hello developers,
I went several times thru the Doc, and could not find anything related to
this.
The echo function is useful for debug, but would be even better if we could
write to another device (file)
I use echo to keep track of all the parts in my project, but it would be
great If I could create a file of all the echo(), i.e. creating an automatic
BOM.

Is that too much to ask?

OpenSCAD is great, and you guys rock!

I had a quick look at pyOCC - Python wrapper for OCE. The quick example I
tried worked quickly and simply, might be a useful interface for test
purposes.

However, I am going to look at Carve first, this library has been in Blender
for a while and seems to have got positive comments from users. Carve has a
GPL2 or GPL3 license, so should be OK.

I have most of the OpenSCAD gui working without CGAL, except for the preview
mode which I have been able to get working. CGAL has hooks in quite a few
functions, it will take a little while to tease out the dependencies. 

I will try to make some notes as I go along, which may serve as a "How to"
guide for replacing CGAL.

I've realised that CGAL has some unique features and quirks, which may be
difficult or impractical to replicate with a different CSG engine, which may
mean a hard choice whether to support multiple backends, or drop certain
features that users currently depend on.

This switch has bitrotted quite a bit, but the original idea was to be able to use it to turn off all CGAL code, but still have a workable binary.
As you figured out, the preview mode is dependent on GeometryEvaluator for the features not implemented there (like minkowski, hull etc.). This make it is a bit annoying to simply pull the CGAL implementation.

The correct solution would be to perform a green refactoring of the compile switch and any API changes. Carve has been on my radar for a while.
I found a comment related to carve robustness here: https://github.com/jamesgregson/pyPolyCSG
..so carve might need some testing.

if one attempts

the compiler does not complain, but it does not do the obvious thing, either

if one attempts

if ((x==1) or (x==2))

one does get a compiler error message

if one attempts

if ((x==1) || (x==2))

it works.

I would advocate that the first syntax should generate an error message

The first one is valid syntax. It means if x is one call module "or"
passing x==2, i.e. false.

It gives WARNING: Ignoring unknown module 'or'. Unless you have a module
called or.

You can do it running from the command line, I don't think it can be done in
the GUI.

On windows, I do this :

"C:\Program Files\OpenSCAD\openscad.exe"
"c:\github\openscad\examples\Old\example001.scad" -o test.csg 2>out.txt

at a command prompt to get the output. You might need to adjust the paths,
but the important bits are "2>" to redirect stderr to the file and "-o
test.csg" to stop the GUI launching.

I expect something similar works for Unix.

Thank you Bob. I am running on a macbook (OS X Yosemite), and I will try to figure out
how to do that in a terminal window.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] working with a complex model
Message-ID: <55817390.1040404@jonbondy.com>

I'm working with a complex model, one that takes minutes to compute.  
I'm fiddling with a small part of the model: most of the model never 
changes.

Is there any way to compute that invariant part once, so that the 
re-calculations are less time consuming as I work on the rest of the model?

Thanks!

Jon

If you put render() around it then it gets computed by CGAL and cached. So
F5 is slow if it changes but fast if it doesn't. Don't forget to set the
convexity parameter if you don an operations on it outside the render.

So THAT is what render() is for! The description says to use when 
"boolean operations become slow".  I had no idea...

As always, thank you for your help!

The things that are computed in my render() are essentially global 
variables, that are used elsewhere in the script.  They then become 
unknown outside the scope of the render().

You only need to put the geometry in the render(), not variable definitions
that need to be global.

The way I make a large assembly like Mendel90 is to have a module for each
printed part. When that is used in an assembly it is rendered. That means I
can work on the part on its own without the render but the large assembly
of parts is still fast because they are all cached. All my vitamins have
renders in them one for each colour. So if I use a lot of fasteners there
is only one cached version of each size of screw, for example.

Using render also gets rid of artefacts in OpenSCG caused by negative parts
of one object interfering with another object.

Wow. There are a bunch of new (?) modifiers I didn't know about.
Thanks for that Michael.

My first post.  I tried IRC, but couldn't find anyone, or I was in the wrong
place.

Anyway, I've been working on my first polyhedron for a bit now.  I got it
just like I wanted it, and everything displays fine.  However, when I tried
to render, the polyhedrons just disappear.  There is no message in the
console.  All my triangles appear correct when I View->show edges.  I was
hoping that someone might tell me how to go about troubleshooting this.  I'm
not sure where to look for debug information.

Here is my complete code, but the fins are what is causing the problem.  

Thanks.

Some faces are flipped, you can see that in the "Thrown Together" view
(those show up in pinkish color).

See https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Primitive_Solids#polyhedron

> Here is my complete code, but the fins are what is causing the problem.

Try with:

faces=[[0,2,1],[0,3,2],[0,4,3],[5,6,7],[5,7,8],[5,8,9],[0,1,5],[1,6,5],[1,2,6],[6,2,7],[2,8,7],[2,3,8],[3,9,8],[3,4,9],[5,4,0],[5,9,4]]

Maybe  "Thrown Together" view could be renamed to something more
descriptive. Maybe:
polyhedron-check-view

Or is there another use for the "Thrown Together" view that I`m not aware
of?

I think it would be more useful if it was transparent (a=0.5 say).
ATM it doesn't show internal inverted faces.

how would I add all the values together to get 115?

One option (should work even with long lists, if I did not mess up the tail recursion...):

function sum(list, idx = 0, result = 0) = idx >= len(list) ? result : sum(list, idx + 1, result + list[idx]);

a = [1, 5, 7, 90, 10];
echo(sum(a));

ECHO: 113

ciao,

I get 113:

a = [1, 5, 7, 90, 10];

function sum(a,i)=(i==0)?a[0]:a[i]+sum(a,i-1);

echo(sum(a,4));

ah. but to get 115 your function needs to add +2 to whatever it finds!

where would I find the list of fixes/updates/new features for any version?
or specifically for this version?

I tried to find the release notes, but can't find them.

Snapshot builds like 2015.06.21 do not have manually maintained
release notes.

What happened between a specific release and some date can be
visualized on github with:

https://github.com/openscad/openscad/compare/openscad-2015.03-1...master@{2015-06-27}

For the bigger changes, you want to watch out for the lines with
"Merge pull request #xxxx". Clicking on the "..." button will
reveal the title of that change, clicking on the number #xxxx
links to the details.

Unfortunately this view does not seem to allow much filtering
or formatting.

ciao,
   Torsten.

This is no OpenSCAD script. From the syntax it looks like some
python wrapper (maybe https://github.com/kevinmehall/pyscad ?).
But there are lots of python related project, so it's hard to tell
which one it actually is.

Maybe have a look at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:187131
which has the scad script attached.

Thanks Torsten, there are quite alot of error codes on Thingiverse.?
I have managed the sierpinski with spheres, some of the sizes are wrong, here it is:

I keep trying to cut the bottom off of this horn (both inside the Horn 
module, and when it is called at the bottom) with no joy. Puzzled.

I'm also seeing a log like this:
     Warning: Normalized tree is growing past 200000 elements. Aborting 
normalization.
     Normalized CSD tree has 6767 elements

It may be clear to some of you how one tree became > 200000 (or is it 
2000000?) while the other tree was a mere 6000.

That could be a bug.
If you increase the Edit/Preference/Advanced/TurnOffRenderingAt setting to
400000 it goes away.

Interesting observation, the model (with normalisation) challenges my
graphics system, but when Aborting normalization happens it displays
easily??

I increased the TurnOffRenderingAt to 400,000 and the difference still 
fails (Windows 64); not sure what you meant by "it goes away".  The 
rendering is so slow that it is impossible to use, aborted or not.  And 
you can imagine how long F6 would take.  Not the best way to use 
OpenSCAD I fear.

I wonder if the community would benefit from some general purpose 
tube/horn facility that was customizable.  I realize that Kit Wallace's 
stuff (derived from NopHead) is a bit like that, but not easy to use (at 
least for me).

Do you still get the Warning msg? If so make the setting bigger.

Ahh! I changed the step number in the for() loops to 3, to cut down on the
number of triangles.

I was not getting the warning and the cutting off the base was working OK.
I reduced the setting to 200,000 and got the Warning and the cut did not
work.
I changed it back to 400,000 and "it goes away". Win7/64

Your current design uses sphere(), I was just considering using a short
cylinder() instead, it will have fewer triangles to deal with.

Yes, OpenSCAD gets difficult with really large numbers of faces...

With your original design, I had to go to 3,000,000 for it to work.
OpenSCAD was extreeeeemly unresponsive. Not going to try F6 ;)

I'm not sure of the what's happening internally when the normalisation is
aborted. That may be the bug, or a limitation.?

But when the Warning is not occurring the difference() works properly.

Don't know him, sorry. But may I ask you for the link to the module?

Here is a way to make a horn by moving a circle along the winded horn path.
This uses chain hull.
It has a comparable resolution, but has less than 20000 elements.
Thus it takes 8 sec. for a F5 on my netbook (1ghz). But a F6 is,as of yet,
unresponsive.

Ich probiere gerade aus kurze Antworten statt gar keine Antworten zu
schreiben.
Wenn Du gerne mehr lesen m?chtest, dann lass es mich bitte wissen.

P.S. In case my e-mail is shorter than you enjoy:
I am currently trying short replies instead of no replies at all.
Please let me know, if you like to read more.

Enjoy!

Peter:

Wow!  Under 1 second for F5 on my machine, and resulting in an object 
that is easily viewable.  Kudos.

I gather that this is a framework that you use often to create shapes 
like this?  I saw remnants of other functions that had been commented out.

Your code is copyrighted: may I use it to create shapes?

Thanks again. This group is the greatest!

Subject: [OpenSCAD] color in renderer for visualization
Message-ID: <20150630121831.GA12005@localhost>

Hi,

I'm trying to use OpenSCAD to create and visualize 3D-models,
both static ones and animated ones. Using different colors
is crucial here.

Unfortunately, there seems to be no way to keep the colors when
rendering the model.

So, I would like OpenSCAD to be able to render in color. I'm a
programmer, so maybe I could even implement it, but I currently
don't know where to start. I don't know the sourcecode, but
I can think of several ways:

1. Transfer the color-information to CGAL.
   CGAL seems to have some color support, and the rendered models already
   have two colors: yellow as default, and light green for faces resulting
   e.g. from "difference()". It it would be possible to communicate the
   color to CGAL and use CGALs color-features, this would be the easiest way.

2. Add color-support to CGAL.
   If CGALs color-support isn't sufficient, CGAL could be extended, and
   then (1) could be done.

3. Use a different render-backend than CGAL.
   I think it would be too much effort to change the backend just to get
   colors. But if (1) and (2) do not work, this one would.
   And e.g. a POVRay-backend would be cool, even if (1) or (2) work. ;)

4. Use render() as workaround.
   I shortly noticed, that rendered objects *can* be colored:

   - color("red") cube(100);
     -> red cube
   - render() color("red") cube(100);
     -> yellow cube ("no color-support")
   - color("green") render() color("red") cube(100);
     -> green cube (yay, color for rendered objects!)

   I haven't used this much, and don't know if there are any pitfalls,
   but this seems to make it possible to color rendered objects. And
   since this seems to work, I think (1) should work, too.

Can you tell me, if (1) should work and where I would have to start to
implement it? Or, if I should use one of the other ways (or even a
different one), and where to start then?


best regards
Roland

If you just want a picture you don't need to use CGAL, F5 gives a coloured
render. F6 is for making solid models to export but the file formats don't
have colour anyway.

Better color handling is a periodic request. My recent analysis revealed it
is not as simple as adding a color property to polygons, the CSG engine must
take account of the color property to properly support it.

I had a look for existing knowledge on adding color to CGAL, but drew a
blank. I also found that color properties require more CSG operations, and
CGAL is quite slow already, so I also wanted to look at swapping out the CSG
back end, also on the long term todo list.

Therefore I am building an experimental Openscad using the Carve library for
CSG, and then later will add support for color and material properties. This
development can be found at https://github.com/bobc/openscad/tree/carve_csg.
This is very much work in progress; it builds with carve lib, but does not
produce any useful output yet. I haven't put carve into qmake system yet, so
libcarve needs to be built separately and copied in.

But as nophead says, do you need to render for your purposes? I'm not sure
how you intend the visualization stage.

AMF supports color. 

There is also a significant chicken and egg here which seems to stifle
progress. While Openscad does not support color, there is little incentive
to implement any of the several formats that do support color. The lack of
those export formats is then used to justify not supporting color in
Openscad...

what needs to be done to speed up rendering using F6?

now it's all single-threaded, which i believe is the majority of the 
"complicated stuff seemingly takes eons to rendah" issue.

i recently installed a mid-range GPU card (Nvidia 760x) and the results 
are dramatic decreases (for some software) in render time.  but no 
bennies using OpenSCAD.

i'm sure others have requested F6 improvements, and iirc i read a 
missive somewhere that indicated a new rendering library or other 
software needs to be setup in OpenSCAD, and that this is a non-trivial 
issue.

can i help with this in any way?  please lmk.

Yes, currently that's not supported, but it certainly is quite
a big point on the wish-list.

Have a look at http://forum.openscad.org/Semantics-CSG-ops-with-respect-to-color-materials-td12667.html
for some recent discussion.

There are other CGAL issues (mainly speed) too, so there is the
idea to switch to a different backend for the CSG operations...

...but it's probably not going to be easy. There are a number of
options, but nothing yet which really screams "Use me, I'm the
perfect solution".

https://github.com/openscad/openscad/wiki/Project%3A-Survey-of-CSG-algorithms
lists some of the contenders, some are old and barely maintained.
OpenCascade is likely able to do the job, but is probably 50 times
larger than OpenSCAD itself :-).

Another recent discussion about that topic:
http://forum.openscad.org/Odd-ternary-behaviour-2015-05-15-nightly-git-5451fab-td12784.html

That's still only working in preview mode. The render() call forces mesh
generation (evaluate CSG ops) so the result is one single mesh, even in
preview mode. The color around render() works as this is then again painted
via the OpenCSG library. Using F6 to force a full render still removes
the color.

I don't know CGAL well enough to say if (1) is actually possible.
 From what I see it's not possible with the data structure we currently
use. Maybe there's some additional stuff somewhere in CGAL.

I guess the best way forward is to join forces with Bob (first forum
link) who is currently investigating this topic. I'm not sure what the
best topic to start with is... there's quite a number of possible options.

There's one task (which is likely a bit boring) which was started
by Bob already. That's isolating CGAL again as the code separation
to build OpenSCAD without CGAL seems to have bitrotted quite a bit.
(http://forum.openscad.org/Building-OpenSCAD-without-CGAL-td12880.html)
This would open up easier ways for trying one or more of the other
existing libraries.

I offer to help with the boring part :-)

ciao,
   Torsten.

OpenSCAD supports AMF and SVG (for 2D) exports.

Also OFF is supported which I think can support color too.

OBJ support is not finished yet, but there's a branch in the repo to add
support and OBJ would support color.

So the egg is already there. Or is it the chicken? :-)

I believe we need a new rendering engine.
Primarily, it needs to use floating point, instead of dynamically
allocated, variable length rational numbers.
After that, multi-core support and GPU support (eg, OpenCL) would make it
faster.

I was recently looking at the PLaSM rendering engine.
Written in C++, open source with a GPL3 licence.
It uses floating point, claims to be fast, there are conference papers
about the
algorithms they use, and it might be good robust code
due to the long history of the project (since 1997 or so).

One interesting feature of the engine is "progressive preview", where it
shows you progressively more detailed renders of the model during preview.
They haven't released an open source progressive previewer, though, and it
might not be easy to take advantage of the feature. Still, I like the idea
of
progressive preview, since some models will always take an hour to preview
no matter how fast the engine. People will just start creating more complex
models.

No general minkowski sum. Lots of other interesting primitives that we
don't have,
including the ability to use 1D and 2D shape objects. Their cylinder
primitive
is implemented by computing the cartesian product of a 2D circle and a 1D
line segment.

Here's a link to the project page for speeding up F6.
Actually, it's for the initial research component,
as we haven't chosen a new rendering engine yet.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Need help to support 3Dconnexion SpaceNavigator
Message-ID: <559304CF.1070400@unixag-kl.fh-kl.de>

Hi.

Recently I bought a 3Dconnexion SpaceNavigator to use with OpenSCAD. I
know that this gadget is currently not supported by OpenSCAD. But being
a hacker fluent in C and C++, I thought it would be a nice project to
add support for it myself.

3Dconnexion offers a SDK for there devices, but the SDK is poisoned by a
ridiculous restrictive license. The SDK is impossible to use with Open
Source Software.

Fortunately the SpaceNavigator enumerates as an ordinary USB HID. I had
a look into libusb and the documentation here:
http://libusb.org/wiki/APIs#libusb-1.0currentAPIandimplementation
redirected me to HIDAPI:
http://www.signal11.us/oss/hidapi/
This is a small library with support for Mac OS X, Linux, Windows and
FreeBSD. It is a single .h file and a single .c file per platform.

With the help of HIDAPI I got reasonable output from the SpaceNavigator
using a small self written test program. See attachment. So now I can
get proper values for X/Y/Z translation and rotation as well as button
events. All on MacOS X. Fine. Now get this into OpenSCAD!

I tried to hack class QGLView as it handles mouse events. But getting
data from the SpaceNavigator requires a separate thread and Qt complained:
    Cannot make QOpenGLContext current in a different thread

I have no clue about the OpenSCAD source code layout, its dependency
management, (3D) computer graphics nor Qt. So I need a bit of help to
get started with hacking OpenSCAD. As said, I am fluent in C++. So the
basics are covered. Mostly I need to know where to start digging, what
source code files to read, what classes to investigate, where are
similar things done as an example and the like.

Things that need to be done / I need help with:
- Integrate HIDAPI into OpenSCAD.
- At process startup of OpenSCAD I need to hook into a periodic timer
for polling the USB HID or (preferably) I need to spawn a separate
std::thread to read USB HID reports.
- If there is a USB HID report determine if OpenSCAD is in focus and
which window is topmost. Send translate / rotate message to window.
- Handle translate / rotate message from USB HID thread in the window.

Any help appreciated and thanks for your patience.

BobC is investigating changes to OpenSCAD that will make it easier to
replace CGAL with an alternate geometry engine.
That's another step towards faster F6.

Hi,

thanks all for the answers.

> render. F6 is for making solid models to export but the file formats don't
> have colour anyway.
There are 3 reasons why I think F5/preview alone is not enough:

- In several experiments, F5 did not show correct objects, but F6 did.
  (esp.: missing/incomplete difference()-holes, arbitrary ugly points)
- Moving/rotating the F5-preview is really slow for larger models,
  moving/rotating the F6-rendered view is fast.
- Animations of more complex models are really slow without render().

But using F5/preview with render()-wrapped objects should work in most
cases. I really like render(), since this can *really* speed things up,
and removes the penalties for hull or minkowski. And since this also
supports colors (if added externally), I'm quite happy with this
for the moment. So, most of my models will look like:

module ...(...) {
    color(...)
    render(...)
    ...real-model-code
}

But I'm still interested in color-renderers (and faster renderers, of
course), or in render() which uses the colors of its subtree.


Best regards
Roland

Hi,

I've used libusb myself and also wrote a (user-space) mouse driver (for
a touchscreen) for Linux.

I think you don't need to write a SpaceNavigator libusb-hid-driver.
At least for Linux, several usb-hid-drivers for the SpaceNavigator
exist (e.g.: http://janoc.rd-h.com/archives/74). I think there
should also be some for Mac OS X.

And I don't think that OpenSCAD should include hardware-specific
code. Instead, the SpaceNavigator should behave like a normal (extended)
mouse or joystick. The operating-system and window-manager should
handle the USB-polling, determine the current window and send
mouse-events to this window. At least that's how I think it should
be done.

You can also google for SpaceNavigator and FreeCAD -- it looks like
someone has already done something similar to implement SpaceNavigator-
support in FreeCAD (which also uses Qt AFAIK).


just my 2 ct,
Roland
