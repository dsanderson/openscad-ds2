thanks! But I don't think you get the picture. I am modeling very small. Can
not be hollow. A pipe runs down the side of a steam engine boiler' the

Subject: [OpenSCAD] OpenSCAD modules and functions list in editors Geany or
	Notepad++
Message-ID: <1443739413072-14042.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi,

Does someone achieved to get a list of OpenSCAD modules and functions in
Geany's 'symbol table' or in Notepad++ 'function list' windows?  I'm using
the OpenSCAD configuration files for those editors found in Thingiverse but
I only get a list of symbols if define the .scad file as a C, C++ or C#
types file. It would be very handy to have this functionality. I tried to
change some configuration files in those editors without success. I'm not a
programming expert. Any help is welcome. 
Thanks a lot.

this will do it, to regulate the angle prefectly you can make a cube that
cuts the cylinder in half and then union two half cylinders, with one
rotated 0-180 degrees to get 0-180 pie sections.



add this to windows sidebar: http://www.openscad.org/cheatsheet/

here is the same as the sketch with a diameter of 4mm, change one of the cube
resize values to change the notch width. check the cylinder in the manual to
change the number of vertices on it.

Message-ID: <1443797456384-14045.post@n5.nabble.com>

In the manual section for strings ( OpenSCAD_User_Manual/General#Strings ), I
suspect the version number 2013.02.28 is wrong. It implies that a change was
made after 2011.04, which I doubt since the current version 2015.03 has the
same output as that shown for 2011.04.

The manual has the following:

Note: This behavior is new since OpenSCAD-2011.04. You can upgrade old files
using the following sed command: sed 's/\\/\\\\/' non-escaped.scad >
escaped.scad

Example:

 echo("The quick brown fox \tjumps \"over\" the lazy dog.\rThe quick brown
fox.\nThe \\lazy\\ dog.");

Output:
ECHO: "The quick brown fox jumps "over" the lazy dog.
The quick brown fox.
The \lazy\ dog."

Output: in OpenSCAD version 2013.02.28
ECHO: "The quick brown fox \tjumps \"over\" the lazy dog.
The quick brown fox.\nThe \\lazy\\ dog."

There is this: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:167899  for Notepad++  and
a couple of others on Thingiverse.  I was in the midst of a significant
upgrade to the tooltips and keywords, but got sidetracked by a trip to the
hospital.  I'll try to get that update finished and posted this weekend.

Thanks for your reply. It seems to me that we have to make a new parser
section in "functionList.xml" for notepad++ to work. For Geany I have no
idea. I tried to modify one of the existing parser sections to detect the
words "module" and "function" but I had no success. I tried with this code:
...
	<association ext=".scad" id="OpenSCAD"/>
			
</associationMap>
		
<parsers>

   <parser id="OpenSCAD" displayName="OpenSCAD Module"
commentExpr="((/\*.*?\*)/|(//.*?$))">
	<function
	     mainExpr="^[\t ]*(module|function)\w+"
		displayMode="$functionName">
		   <functionName>
                        <nameExpr expr="[^\t(module|function)]+[\w]+"/>
                   </functionName>
	 </function>
    </parser>

Best regards.

Is the one listed in the Manual not working anymore?
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Using_an_external_Editor_with_OpenSCAD

If that's the case, it would be better to remove it there or add a note
if it's only working for older versions.

ciao,

I was editing an openSCAD file last night and found that a chunk of the text
was being replicated like (CTR-V) into the body of the text every time the
mouse scroll button 'clicked' over, leaving a trail of 'entered' extra
lines.  The text was also copied into other random parts of the script as
well.  I was using the 64Bit XUbuntu 15.04.x on a Mac-Book Pro, hence the
64bit version of open SCAD Ver 2015.03-1.  I returned to my 32 bit version
(open SCAD Ver 2015.03-1) on my usual PC machine to fix it up in the end. 
Has anyone else had this problem, or could it be a problem with my
underlying OS??

Cheers, RobW

RobW,

Why are you using the XUbuntu version instead of the OS X version?
I do not have this problem with OS X on a Macbook pro with retina display.

Hi,
I've been noticing a random mouse behavior when using OpenSCAD. This is not
systematic. The mouse movement is OK, however the mouse keys do not behave
correctly. I?m using a cable usb mouse. I thought it could be the mouse
microswitch or the cable. After cable inspection and a microswitch changing
the problem started again. I think that is an OpenSCAD problem, however I'm
not sure. I can say that until now the problem do not exist when using other
programs. Must say that the erratic behavior of the mouse is not solved
simply by disconnecting the usb cable and connecting again. The computer
only returns to normal after a shutdown. I'm feeling that maybe memory
corruption can be the issue.
I'm using OpenSCAD version 2015.03-1 on a 64 bit Windows 7 OS.
The most annoying symptoms in my case are window opening freezing or opening
a down level and returning to the upper level after some milliseconds.  
Regards.

Hello,
Yes, it does it does syntax highlight and color and auto completion. I'm
referring to navigation of modules and functions in the symbols windows.
That functionality is missing in the OpenSCAD config files for both
Notepad++ and Geany. I'm using 64 bit Windows 7 OS.
Regards

I  don't have a new MacBookPro, but an older one that is a recent 
'hand-me-up' as it was given to me by my son with Ubuntu 15.04.x already 
running quite nicely on it (The OS-X crashes and I prefer open source 
products).  However the Ubuntu 'Apple mouse-pad' drivers were annoying, 
so I had connected a old, but perfectly good USB cable Microsoft optical 
mouse.  After that a number of factors contributed to my posting for 
help, as well as my general ignorance. The problem is not with openSCAD, 
so non-Debian Linux readers may as well stop here.

First to waste as little time as possible, I will post the Ubuntu OS 
solution that worked for me:

#Removes the 'paste' action of highlighted text by the mouse 'scroll' 
wheel when it is is clicked. NB no Crtl-C need have been entered for 
this to occur.
mouse_id=$(xinput list | grep 'Mouse' | awk '{print $9}' | sed 
's/[^0-9]//g') && xinput set-button-map "$mouse_id" 1 0 3

Add the above line to the ~/.profile file and it will map out the scroll 
wheel click next time you login.  The person who wrote this command was 
very clever, as in one line it manages to read the name of the device 
and then apply that to the mapping command itself, a tribute to the 
power of the Linux command line, even if somewhat cryptic and in-elegant 
to a person with my skills. (The mapping concept allows right and 
lefthanded-ness of mice to be controlled, as well as customizing/mapping 
all sorts of pointing devices for people with disabilities).

For those who have more time to spare here is the full explanation:

My downstairs desktop (32Bit) and MacBook(64Bit) both run Ubuntu quite 
nicely and I am very happy with both.  However the downstairs desktop 
where I began most of the openSCAD development has a much stiffer 
'click' to its scroll wheel, so the problem appeared to be only on the 
MacBook (64Bit).  Plus another two things contributed to my posting. The 
first was I was totally unaware of this Ubuntu mouse feature, so I was 
oblivious for the need to avoid accidental clicks when scrolling, and 
the second was Ubuntu (and probably other Debian derivatives) has three 
levels of copy/clipboard.

The first level of 'copy' occurs when the text is just highlighted, the 
second level occurs after Ctrl-C has been pressed (which makes it 
available to Ctrl-V etc), and a third level that makes copied items 
available externally to other applications.

The 'mouse scroll wheel click' pastes what is in the first level, so 
text that has only been highlighted can be copied with a wheel click, 
even though it has never been Ctrl-C'ed!!!  As I was moving a lot of 
whole lines of code in my openSCAD scripts to put them either within a 
'difference' (hence invisible, but often somewhere I could not figure 
out) or pull them out of a 'difference' to make them visible, I was 
using this a lot.

The fact that bits of text were suddenly appearing at what seemed at 
random, especially stuff that I knew I had not even copied, let alone 
pasted (but often may have highlighted and then changed my mind, and not 
even Ctrl-C'ed) is now not so surprising, and I apologise to those who 
have slogged though this far, the 'fault' does not have its origin in 
openSCAD.

Thank you for your time and patience....

After some testing, I can say that the erratic mouse behavior described by me
in the last post IS NOT AN OPENSCAD PROBLEM. Sorry guys but coincidences do
exist. It is caused by the hub I have the mouse connected to. When I connect
a pen drive to the hub to make my backups sometimes the mouse becomes crazy.
Regards

Subject: [OpenSCAD] version() function
Message-ID: <1443971537554-14055.post@n5.nabble.com>

according to the user manual

version() and version_num() will return OpenSCAD version number.

    The version() function will return the OpenSCAD version as a vector,
e.g. [2011, 09, 23]
    The version_num() function will return the OpenSCAD version as a number,
e.g. 20110923

but when I try using them I only gets zeros.

echo(version()); 
echo(version_num());
x = version(); echo(x);
y = version_num(); echo(y);

results:

ECHO: [0, 0, 0]
ECHO: 0
ECHO: [0, 0, 0]
ECHO: 0

What am I missing?

I don't know, I get this:

ECHO: [2015, 5, 16]

ECHO: 2.01505e+007

ECHO: [2015, 5, 16]

ECHO: 2.01505e+007


You must have a bad build.


It doesn't seem correct that echo uses scientific notation when natural
notation is shorter and more precise.

   number, e.g. 20110923


But it really comes back in scientific notation. To me that is a bug. minor
one, but one none-the-less.

Not really, version_num() does return the correct value. How it's printed
with echo() is a different matter.
It could be argued that means for specific formatting are missing, though.

Exactly, Paul.

OpenSCAD limit the print to 6 significant digits which is wrong in the case of version_num() that requires 7 digits.

Then, try this:

1) Take out the translate([off,0,0]). This will make it symmetric off XY
plane
2)  Add a new translate( [offx, offy,0] ) as shown below. This will simply
push the bar away from the center.

The idea is to delay the translation until the final rotation is made. The
offx, offy are to be calculated using cos and sin, which shouldn't be hard.

It looks of identical length above and below the Z=0 plane to me..

Your thinking is wrong, meaning your visualisation of what should have
happened is not quite what you have actually done. Use the % operator in
front of the bar(...) statement inside the for loop, to make your bars
transparent. Then use your mouse to rotate your shape, and you'll see . . .

for (i=[0:(steps-1)]) {
    rotate([0, 0, i*(360/steps)])
 %   bar(width, thick, length, offs);

Because your bar is not rotation symmetric, your shape isn't either. Replace
cube([x,y,z],center=true); 
with
cylinder(d=x,h=z,center=true);
and get the hyperboloid you're after . . .

Message-ID: <1444047141802-14068.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi, 

Has anyone upgraded from 4 to 16 gigabytes of DDR and found that they can
process much larger .scad files? Does the memory inflate exponentially or is
there a roughly linear balance in between the number of CGAL functions used
and the memory used? 

Can you put a figure, say, "my 16gig pc managed to union 500 spheres with
radius 10 without bugging"
because i can union about 4000 simple 4-20 vertex objects with 4 gigs of
ram, but it tends to crash with 100 vertex spheres if i have 200 of them or
something.

I definitely think it would be good to release versions every 3-4 months, the
last release was from 6 months ago perhaps and i have to install Ubuntu to
compile the sources, i haven't had the time to think even on what partition
and with which boot manager i will have ubuntu on pc. even if you have any
unofficial releases, you can post a link to a .zip file here i will jump on
it.

You can always just track the nightly build on Ubuntu. Those are actually
built after every check-in to the master branch on github.

The packages are designed to be installable in parallel to the official
distribution packages (mainly tested on Debian/Ubuntu). So if there's
an issue with the nightly build, the release version is still available.

Windows Snapshot builds are not automatic, I'm only building those if there's
some important change or a specific request.

ciao,

You probably need intersection_for() which prevents the implicit union at for()
that causes "intersection() for()" producing unexpected results.

The shape looks nice. But it is specifically mentioned that "rotation of the
'bar' around its z-axis is a required part of the design", which this answer
failed to fulfill.

I am not sure the exact 30 degree is the requirement:

    rotate([30,0,0])    //Rotate bar x-axis
    rotate([0,0,30])    //Rotate bar z-axis

If not, make z-rotation to 90 and you will get what you want. Here is the
code and an animating object with varying ax from 0 to 60:

ah ok, so with the example with some cubes in a grid i think i have to
compare every cube to every neighbour cube using if statement and distance
and bounding box and intersection any two neighbour cubes and then union the
results... I could even compare every cube with every other cube and union
each comparison. either way, it seems to be a difficult task.

The intersection_for() gives the intersection of all objects in the loop,
whereas i want to keep all the surfaces in the loop where any two of the
objects intersect. it's quite inefficient to compare each object to all the
others, makes roughly 100*100 intersections if there are 100 objects :\

Why don't you write the simplest code that works, using intersection_for,
and *then* see if there is a performance problem that requires
optimization. If the code works, then you were worrying about nothing. If
the code is too slow, then you can show the forum some actual code that we
can play with and propose changes to.

This is my first post to an openscad dlist ever. I haven't been using
openscad for that long, but I'm just incredibly grateful that it exists. If
I'm ever critical in the future, it's because I've come to depend on this
wonderful tool. OMG openscad is sooooo much better than using the !@#$%#@#@
mouse. OMG OMG OMG. Now that I've got my eternal gratefulness off my chest:

In an imperative language it makes some sense to limit recursion to <small
number>, but in a functional language it is hard to (for instance) find the
minimum value of a list without recursion. Recursion is how you iterate over
lists.

I had this same issue with recursion depth in openscad. I figured out how to
turn my recursion into tail recursion, so I'm all set. Alternatively, I
could have used binary subdivision to keep depth down  

function minList(list,start, length) = 
      (length<=1) ? list[start] : min(minList(start, length/2),
minList(start+length/2, length/2);  

this is a little sloppy, but it will actually work and can't recur more than
log_2(len(list)) deep.


I just wanted to make the point that while avoidable, recursion to a depth
equal to the maximum expected number of points in a list isn't a weird thing
to do.

It would be nifty if the manual said something about tail recursion, or
otherwise gave more of a hint on how to get around small recursion limits.
I'd rather see openscad run out of memory and crash than give up at a
recursion depth of 100.  1,000,000 wouldn't even think about crashing on a
modern PC unless the stack is eensy, and it definitely wouldn't be
antisocial. My F6 renders can take a couple of hours.

Here you can imagine me raving again and otherwise wasting bandwidth one
last time about how happy I was to find Openscad. Duuuudes. WTG. etc.

Message-ID: <1444234194180-14080.post@n5.nabble.com>

I have the following code working correctly:

//Size of larger tube?
tube_1 = 33.7; //[13.8:BT-5, 18.7:BT-20, 24.8:BT-50, 33.7:BT-55, 34.2:BT-56,
41.6:BT-60, 56.3:BT-70, 66.04:BT-80, 100:BT-101]

//Size of smaller tube?
tube_2 = 13.8; //[13.8:BT-5, 18.7:BT-20, 24.8:BT-50, 33.7:BT-55, 34.2:BT-56,
41.6:BT-60, 56.3:BT-70, 66.04:BT-80, 100:BT-101]

//How long do you want the taper to be?
taper_length = 25;

//Diameter of the hole through the center?  Use "0" for no hole.  Must be
smaller than diameter of the small tube.
hole = 12.4;

wall_1 = .53;

wall_2 = .33;

difference(){

union(){
    
cylinder(h=taper_length, r1=tube_1/2, r2=tube_2/2, center=false, $fn=100);

translate([0,0,taper_length]) cylinder(h=12.7,r=tube_2/2-wall_2,
center=false, $fn=100);

translate([0,0,-12.7]) cylinder(h=12.7,r=tube_1/2-wall_1, center=false,
$fn=100);
}

translate([0,0,-12.7]) cylinder(h=taper_length+25.4, r=hole/2, center=false,
$fn=100);    
}

I would like the "wall_1" and "wall_2" values to be dependent upon the
selections for "tube_1" and "tube_2".  I have been trying to use an if/else
statement but I haven't been able to get it to work.

I am trying to do something like "If tube_1=13.8, 18.7, or 24.8; then
wall_1=0.33, else wall_1=0.53".

Any ideas?

I would like the "wall_1" and "wall_2" values to be dependent upon the
selections for "tube_1" and "tube_2".  I have been trying to use an if/else
statement but I haven't been able to get it to work.

I am trying to do something like "If tube_1=13.8, 18.7, or 24.8; then
wall_1=0.33, else wall_1=0.53".

Any ideas?

Hi John,

To clarify:
In OpenSCAD, recursion depth is currently limited by stack size, not a fixed maximum depth. The exception to this is tail recursion which is converted into a loop, where we cut at 1M iterations (since there is no stack growth) to avoid infinite loops.

Are you saying that 1M is too hard of a limit for your design? I?d love to see practical examples of this :)

Having a better way of reporting and cancelling potentially infinite jobs could be a decent alternative to such a limit. 
I would prefer if we didn?t crash or lock up, forcing users to kill the process in these cases.

 -Marius

Thanks for getting back to me Marius.

I was getting "recursion detected errors", so I did a search for the
problem. This forum thread seemed to indicate that the non-tail recursion
depth was 100. My function should have been recurring to a depth of about
10,000.

It's possible that my function was recurring deeper due to a bug that got
fixed when I switched to tail recursion. I don't know. It's hard to find
bugs in functions without the proposed fecho function (separate issue).  1M
iterations seems like a fine limit to me. I don't think I'd have time to
render very many 1M point polyhedra. :)

Just to add to the information base:

I have a new notebook with an Intel 5500 graphics card running Windows 10.
I found the same problem displaying difference() in render mode.

Forcing GoldFeather did the trick.

It may not but a bug but the nature of non-tail recursion, in which when you
set to recur n times, the times it call the function is actually far more n. 
Consider this example that calc the !n = 1*2*3...*n:

function prod(n)= n<=1?1
                         : n*prod(n-1);  

echo( prod(3) ) ==> 1*2*3 = 6
echo( prod(4) ) ==> 1*2*3*4 = 24

 That is, when you increase the n from 2 to 3, the times the prod(n) is
called increases from 2 to 4, not 2 to 3. Let's see more:     

>     prod(4):            4) outermost call (n=4)= 1        3) 4*prod(3) ==>

> = 1        ---------------------------        ==>             #n(4)  = 8           
> prod(5):            5) outermost call (n=5)= 1        4) 5*prod(4) ==>

> ---------------------------        ==>             #n(5)  = 16

>From these we can observe:

1) Most of the calls are repetitive. For example, if you do prod(5), the
same prod(2) is calculated 3 times. 
2) When asking a non-tail recursive function to run *n* steps, it actually
call itself *(n-1)^2* times, but not *n* times;

This means that your function is actually called  (10,000-1)^2 times when
you set the step to 10,000. Maybe that's where the problem is.

It works, it goes kindof slowly, intersection of only neighbours in 16 cubes
takes 18 seconds versus 2 seconds for only union.

I don't see why that is the case. The function will recurse until n = 1. At
that point you have n stack frames on the stack. The top one returns 1, the
one below it returns 2 * 1, next one 3 * 2 and so on. Why do you think it
gets called more than once for a particular n?

You are right, nophead. I was thinking too much and fall into my own trap. 
Thx for pointing that out.

A small change to the prod( ) to prove how wrong I was:

A trick similar like this is what I use often to debug a recursive function.

More or less for fun, here is the tail recursive version that finds the min
value in a specified dimension (dI=dimension index) in a list of points.
There is a non-recursive wrapper.

function minDimPtsTail(pts, end, minSoFar, dI, index)=
     (index < end) ?
     minDimPtsTail(pts, end, min(minSoFar, pts[index][dI]), dI, index + 1) :
     minSoFar;

function minDimPts(pts, dI, index=0)=
     minDimPtsTail(pts, len(pts), pts[index][dI], dI, index+1);

We recently lifted the recursion limitation (2015.03), so some old discussion are not valid any longer.

Thanks to the encouragement of a couple of principal members, I have become
brave enough to make changes to parts of the manual. I have added examples
and hopefully made them more readable.

While I play with them in the sandbox, and reread them several times before
posting, I still miss things.

I really miss someone to proofread before I post.

I wanted to do a find/replace. Filled in find with "Sqrt" and replace with
"sqrt", hit replace button, worked fine. Hit "All" button and crashed
OpenSCAD. Restarted, reconstructed work, saved, did it again, same thing.

Sometimes the red dot doesn't mean that's exactly where you make a mistake.
So check the lines following the red cursor as well. Very often it's a
mismatch of { } or [ ].

Secondly, to get a "round-trip" time fraction, you can try :

// Linear stepping

> interval = 0.2;
> range = concat( [ for(i=[0:interval:1]) i]
>               , [ for(i=[1-interval:-interval:0]) i]
>               ); 
> echo( range );
> 
> // ECHO: [0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, 5.55112e-17]

// In some situations, a stepping following a sin wave might be preferred
for smoother u-turn :

> interval = 0.1;
> for(t = [0:interval:1])
>     echo( str(t, " ==> ", sin( t*180) ));

Hello lboyd

I would be more than willing to prof read any material for you.

Just drop me a note with the material and a time line.

Here is one possibility which moves the later part of your script to another
module so it can be more easily used within the scope of the if().

module coaster(element){
        if (element=="Hydrogen") rest_of_coaster(1,"Hydrogen","H",1.008);
  else if (element=="Helium")     rest_of_coaster(2,"Helium", "He",4.003);
}
    
module rest_of_coaster(atomic_number,element,symbol,atomic_mass){
  // do whatever
}

A different approach is this

  element_data = [[0,"","",0],  // must be in order
    [1,"Hydrogen","H",1.008],   // indexed via atomic number
    [2,"Helium",  "He",4.003]     // redundant atomic number to preserve
your sanity later
  ];

  Hydrogen = 1;
  Helium   = 2;
    
module coaster(atomic_number){
    element       = element_data[atomic_number][0];
    symbol        = element_data[atomic_number][1];
    atomic_mass= element_data[atomic_number][2];
//rest of script
    }

Nice. One thing you can aim at for the future is to show the atomic and/or
molecular hybrid orbitals in 3d, which is difficult for students to picture.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] String manipulation functions
Message-ID: <CA+HE+0LXB+E9xpbVkELAJ=APb7GEweokBHX9fB4i4La8Zy4Kqg@mail.gmail.com>

So I want to make a new string that is the first n characters of the old
string

str1="drxenocide"

first(2) str1;

should yield "dr".

My guess was:

function first(n)=[for(i=[0:n-1]){children(0)[i]}];

But it doesn't work, and i'm pretty sure it has multiple problems. Could
someone make this work? Or tell me why it isn't possible?

Now that we have string manipulation, it would be nice if someone could
make all of the excel functions, and put them in a reference file. I COULD
do this, but I am obviously too stupid to do it right now.

Thanks.

Although that is correct syntax it won't do what the user intends.

You need something like:
clipped_form = form > 1 ? 1 : form;

or

clipped_form = min(1, form);

You can't reassign variables.

I don't think there's something like an official documentation. It's
essentially scad without any modules, variables and such.

If I can believe  Wikipedia
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry>  , 
OpenSCAD is mostly Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG). But OpenSCAD als uses 
boundary representation
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_representation>   (b-rep)as the
following bit of code of a simple cube in b-rep shows

polyhedron(
  points=[ [0,0,0],[0,0,1],
          [0,1,0],[0,1,1],
          [1,0,0],[1,0,1],
          [1,1,0],[1,1,1]],
  faces=[ [0,1,3,2],[4,5,7,6],
         // [2,3,7,6],[0,4,5,1],   // faces left out deliberately
          [1,5,7,3],[0,4,6,2] ]);

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n14117/OpenCube.jpg> 

In more complex scripts, b-rep has proven to be a lot faster when
*rendered*, since non-existent faces need not be considered by the renderer.
But *creating* complex shapes using CSG is faster. And if you want to
decorate surfaces of CSG shapes, you are really asking for trouble, since
OpenSCAD does not support access to the surfaces, edges or vertices of its
shape primitives.

That's not b-rep, it's implemented internally as a mesh.

As far as I can see, the given polyhedron has no volume and thus is a
2-manifold, a surface for non-mathematicians. As far as I am aware, solids
have by definition a volume and thus are 3-manifolds (or higher). If you
delete all but one face in the example given, you obtain

polyhedron(
  points=[ [0,0,0],[0,0,1],
          [0,1,0],[0,1,1],],
  faces=[ [0,1,3,2] ]); 

Rendering (F6) produces this output:

Rendering Polygon Mesh using CGAL...
Geometries in cache: 2
Geometry cache size in bytes: 496
CGAL Polyhedrons in cache: 0
CGAL cache size in bytes: 0
Total rendering time: 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds
   Top level object is a 3D object:
   Facets:          1

If the rendered object had a volume (i.e. were a very thin cube), it would
need to have at least 6 facets, more if all facets are triangles. Since only
one facet is reported, the claim that the top level object is a 3D object is
false.

Surfaces can also be rendered as meshes. Claiming that an entity is 3D
because it has been rendered as a mesh is nonsense. And if you are willing
to drop the requirement that meshes must have faces, even a line can be a
mesh: it may have vertices and edges! I am not willing to drop the
requirement that solids have volumes and thus are at least 3-manifolds. 

How I'd wish that programmers do have at least basic scientific training.
Then they would understand that a single example to the contrary invalidates
even the most acclaimed theory and turns it into rubbish. If you can show
that in my example of a cube, with all faces shown, there is indeed an edge
going from point [0,0,0] to point [1,1,1], i.e. through the centre of the
cube, you have invalidated my claims. If you cannot, all you can claim is
that a 2D mesh has been drawn inside a 3-manifold, which is an entirely
acceptable way of doing it - for a b-rep.

Let's see it.

I really don't understand what this discussion is about. Also, I don't
agree with the Wikipedia articles that were cited.

In my experience, every CSG system that I've looked at uses some universal
representation for a solid object, and provides CSG operations that map
solids onto solids. The solid representations I've seen are:

   - boundary rep, eg a polygonal mesh like OpenSCAD. This is the most
   common.
   - Implicit function representation.
   - Voxels.

The Wikipedia articles on CSG and brep appear to draw a false dichotomy
between CSG systems and brep systems. The article on CSG seems to focus on
a hypothetical type of CSG system in which solids are represented as trees,
where the non-leaf nodes are CSG operations, and the leaf nodes are
"primitive solids", whatever that means. These primitive solids logically
*must* have some representation, but Wikipedia appears to rule out brep as
that representation, even though that's the most popular choice in actual
real existing CSG systems. In other words, if a CSG system uses brep, then
Wikipedia claims that it isn't a CSG system, which is wrong.

bobc claims that OpenSCAD is not a brep system, because we use meshes. That
makes no sense. The mesh is used to Represent the Boundary of a 3D object.

wolf points out that there is a bug in the polygon primitive. It doesn't
check the mesh and report an error if the mesh is not manifold, or if the
mesh is inside out. So that's a bug in OpenSCAD, but wolf is using this bug
to make some categorical claim about OpenSCAD that I can't decipher.

The wikipedia entry on CSG is making a statement about CSG operations vs BREP
operations. With CSG operations, if you start with solids, you end up with
solids (floating point implementations willing). With BREP it's super easy
to generate self-intersecting polyhedra which aren't solids.

CSG can be performed on any solids, including the output of BREP modelers: 

Wikipedia entry on Constructive Solid Geometry: 
   "CSG can also be performed on polygonal meshes, "
   "Some software packages allow CSG on curved objects while other packages
do not."
   "When creating geometry based upon boundary representations, additional
topological data is required, or consistency checks must be performed to
assure that the given boundary description specifies a valid solid object"

CSG operations and Brep operations can be provided by the same modelers.
They've got different properties. I've been doing some free-form Brep
manipulations in OpenScad and keeping the polygons consistent and
non-degenerate is an incredible pain. On the other hand, I can make some
nifty smooth objects by applying lots of sin and cosine waves to my object.
Until my surface self-intersects or my polygons become degenerate and I have
to play with it until it's better. 

If you think of Brep and CSG as sets of operations on solids, maybe the
discussion would be less charged? CSG is like + and *. Hard to get in
trouble with, but limited. Brep is like /. Also useful, but dividing by zero
is always a possibility.

?

Getting back to the original question, regardless of what wikipedia may say,
OpenSCAD puts enough information in its .csg to completely recreate your
model. Try loading one and displaying it.

It includes both 2D and 3D primitives.  Rotate and Translate show up as
multmatrix. Variables are absent because the input has been fully compiled
to have constant values.

As far as I can tell, anything from an OpenSCAD  .csg can be included in a
.scad file.

A simple example:

a = 10;
translate([5,4]){
circle(a);
square(a+2);}

generates:

group() {
	multmatrix([[1, 0, 0, 5], [0, 1, 0, 4], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]]) {
		circle($fn = 0, $fa = 12, $fs = 2, r = 10);
		square(size = [12, 12], center = false);
	}
}

Thanks for the explanation, that makes sense to me.

I've looked at a few solid modeling languages with a rich set of operations
on "non manifold objects", but don't have experience with such systems. I
never thought of OpenSCAD as belonging to this category, as I didn't think
there was anything useful you could do with a non-manifold polyhedron. I
could be mistaken about that.

Message-ID: <CAD84F9tfo03bDiXZM_bh=zPXHu7Kv0jia2=Nm6Z-Yy3S_i-_EQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I made a library to help me use OpenSCAD for laser-cut models

https://github.com/bmsleight/lasercut

Features which can be intermixed:-
 * Simple rectangles, or points on a poloygon
 * Simple tabs and tab holes
 * Captive nuts - both parts
 * Box with 4,5 or 6 sides
 * Finger joints
 * Add or remove circles, make a slit or cut-out a rectangle
 * Automatic 3d to 2d layout

The key feature for myself is to generate a 2d files automatically
from the 3d-model, which can uploaded to a laser-cutter. I am not
using python or perl, but using OpenSCAD and the children function to
generate a OpenSCAD file which is 2d and re-uses the library.

Full Readme with examples and images:-
  https://github.com/bmsleight/lasercut/blob/master/README.md

Thanks for OpenSCAD.
Regards,
Brendan

Thanks, guys, that was a very interesting and useful series of comments. 
First, let me explain that what I am after is 3D printing in steel and
aluminium, which requires to push the limits of model accuracy from the
0.03mm useful for plastic printing to 0.003mm as is common with subtractive
machining processes or even 0.00003mm if I need a mirror surface. The 
technology
<http://ibmresearchnews.blogspot.co.nz/2013/05/how-to-move-atom.html>   is
even available to push to single atom accuracy in 3D printing (0.0000002mm).
As part of this effort I currently investigate what OpenSCAD really does vs
what the manual claims it does. I will let you know when the work is
complete.


At the moment, I take it from your contributions that OpenSCAD does
surfaces, not volumes. In a genuine CSG package like BRLCAD, which I
investigated quite some time ago, solids would be defined by, using OpenSCAD
language syntax

sphere(1)=={pow(r,2)=pow(x,2)+pow(y,2)+pow(z,2)}
or 
cube(1)=={pow(r,infinity)=pow(x,infinity)+pow(y,infinity)+pow(z,infinity)}

In OpenSCAD, my current understanding is that a cube is defined by six
simultaneous equations, one for each face:

cube(1)=={x>=0;    y>=0;     z>=0;   x<=1;   y<=1;   z<=1;}

A consequence of this definition (I think in C++ syntax it would be called a
constructor) is the bug listed  here
<http://https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/STL_Import_and_Export> 
. To fix it would require a change of definition for the cube as used in
this code:

//  taken from:
//  https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/STL_Import_and_Export
//  purpose: to show that rendering problems can be avoided by appropriate
programming
Chamfer=0.000002;  //lowest permissible value that does not produce a
warning when rendering:  Chamfer=0.000002

MyCube();
translate([10,10,0])      MyCube();
translate([-10,-10,-10])  cube([30,30,5]);

module MyCube()
  difference()
  { cube([10,10,10], center=true);
    translate([5,5,0])    rotate(45,[0,0,1])  cube([Chamfer,Chamfer,12],
center=true);
    translate([5,-5,0])   rotate(45,[0,0,1])  cube([Chamfer,Chamfer,12],
center=true);
    translate([-5,5,0])   rotate(45,[0,0,1])  cube([Chamfer,Chamfer,12],
center=true);
    translate([-5,-5,0])  rotate(45,[0,0,1])  cube([Chamfer,Chamfer,12],
center=true);
    
    translate([0,5,5])    rotate(90,[0,1,0])  rotate(45,[0,0,1]) 
cube([Chamfer,Chamfer,12], center=true);
    translate([0,5,-5])   rotate(90,[0,1,0])  rotate(45,[0,0,1]) 
cube([Chamfer,Chamfer,12], center=true);
    translate([0,-5,5])   rotate(90,[0,1,0])  rotate(45,[0,0,1]) 
cube([Chamfer,Chamfer,12], center=true);
    translate([0,-5,-5])  rotate(90,[0,1,0])  rotate(45,[0,0,1]) 
cube([Chamfer,Chamfer,12], center=true);
    
    translate([5,0,5])    rotate(90,[1,0,0])  rotate(45,[0,0,1]) 
cube([Chamfer,Chamfer,12], center=true);
    translate([5,0,-5])   rotate(90,[1,0,0])  rotate(45,[0,0,1]) 
cube([Chamfer,Chamfer,12], center=true);
    translate([-5,0,5])   rotate(90,[1,0,0])  rotate(45,[0,0,1]) 
cube([Chamfer,Chamfer,12], center=true);
    translate([-5,0,-5])  rotate(90,[1,0,0])  rotate(45,[0,0,1]) 
cube([Chamfer,Chamfer,12], center=true);
  }
  
Because I am a scientific jerk, someone who rates actual behaviour of a
piece of software above what a programmer  thinks
<http://ask.slashdot.org/story/15/06/18/1634205/ask-slashdot-whats-the-harm-in-a-default-setting-for-div-by-zero> 
, I do dare to step on the toes of those who need it. But I am also willing
to learn from those who point out where facts are in conflict with what I
say or write.

And with that, explicit thanks to doug.moen. His idea for OpenSCAD2 having
just one primitive solid (he calls it  orthogonality
<http://https://github.com/doug-moen/openscad2/blob/master/rfc/Composable_Building_Blocks.md> 
) means that surface() becomes the source and origin of all shapes. That
means, as a designer, I have full control over both the shape and its
surface. I can add to the shape using union(0), or access the vectors
defining the shape and add to them. The latter would mean a dramatic
improvement in rendering speed.

This is soooo nice.

Also great for cnc 

Few more joint types would be nice

Even doing large objects that are 3d printed it would be useful

OpenSCAD is my preferred method for designing 3D objects for printing.  
The novel thing about the original link I provided is that it is devoted 
to creating 2D objects for laser cutting. If you want to learn more 
about OpenSCAD, Google the documentation, manuals, and tutorials.  Or 
invite me to teach an OpenSCAD course at Generator again.

I suspect that might be pushing the current limitations a bit, but
it will be interesting to see the details.

For CSG calculation, OpenSCAD currently uses libCGAL with Nef Polyhedra as
data structure, for details, you can check their documentation.

http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/packages.html#PkgNef3Summary
"3D Nef polyhedra, are a boundary representation for cell-complexes
bounded by halfspaces that supports Boolean operations and topological
operations in full generality including unbounded cells, mixed
dimensional cells (e.g., isolated vertices and antennas). Nef polyhedra
distinguish between open and closed sets and can represent non-manifold
geometry."

I'd like to ask you to engage in discussion but not in a way that "step(s)
on the toes of those who need it". This might be considered ok with some
groups of people and/or when meeting in person, but having a diverse community
with people from around the world also means the perception of what's said
can be quite different. Also not all people (me for example) are native
english speakers, which adds to the risk of misunderstandings.
I know from my own experience how written messages can get out of hand
even with people one knows for years. In one really bad case we could
clear the misunderstandings quite easily by meeting in real life and
talking about it, but we don't always have this option.

Yes, that's one of the big limitations currently. Access to the mesh
from the script would open up a number of new and powerful ways to
write models.

Linux has many different distros and versions, and Openscad has many, too.
Simply saying "Linux distro" provides not much info for people who can help.

For example, I have been using Openscad on Linux Mint for > 2 yrs without
that kind of problem.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] OpenSCAD carving plugin
Message-ID: <d875842079872e82c80759ce9fa018a2@38plumes.fr>

Hi everybody,

I discovered OpenSCAD and CNC milling machine a year ago. Following a 
process of trial and errors (lot of them...), I started to carve wood, 
Plexiglas and aluminum to make parts for robots (that's my spare time 
hobby currently :p). During this time, I have been working on a carving 
'plugin' for OpenSCAD. The need was to have an reliable work-flow to 
make parts using a CNC milling machine using OpenSCAD.

The goal is to try to simplify the creation of parts with CNC milling 
machine and to render them as accurately as possible during design 
steps. As well, CNC milling machines have some specificities which would 
benefit to be integrated:
* The notion of workpiece of a specific material, size and the 
positioning of parts in it.
* Specific G-Code move operations to carve the workpiece or tool 
management like spindle speed, move speed or tool change.
* Multiple pass depending on material, cutting tool and CNC machine.
* Multiple tools (drill-bits for holes, end-mills with different 
diameter for carving, end-mills with head angle to mark folding lines, 
...).


The work-flow could be decomposed in the following steps:

1. When creating and debugging parts, the View -> Carving -> "Render 
Milling Path" mode displays the volume traveled by the CNC milling tools 
following the programmed moves.

2. Once the parts are close to be finished, the View -> Carving -> 
"Render Carving Result" mode displays accurately the volume removed from 
the workpiece to carve the parts. Positions of the parts on the 
workpiece can be optimized too.

3. Finally parts can be extracted from the workpiece using View -> 
Carving -> "Extract Parts for Assembly" mode. Once identified, parts are 
extracted from the workpiece and assembled together to render the final 
result. It is then possible to check how well the parts fit together.

4. Export the parts into G-Code via File -> Export -> "Export as NGC..." 
for manufacturing using LinuxCNC and CNC milling machine!

5. And... enjoy end result.


Development is in progress and there is still room for improvement, but 
at last, the code is finally stable enough to start sharing it with the 
community, so here it is:

Source code is available here: 
https://github.com/peberhard/openscad/tree/carving-plugin

Build information, documentation and examples are available there: 
https://github.com/peberhard/openscad-carving-plugin-doc-examples

Thanks for your feedback,

Pascal

Hi Pascal,

I beg to differ. The translation of the 3D model into a CNC program DOES NOT belong
into OpenSCAD.

Let me explain:
 - OpenSCAD is a modeling tool that create the object you need. So it doesn?t know what
will be the tool used for manufacturing your object.

 - The translation into a tool programming belongs to the CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing)
	software which could be a plug-in into OpenSCAD, but never part of the core program.

 - You want CNC conversion, someone else will want 3D printing software, and someone else
	will want molding software, and so on.

It is better to have a clean interface like now with STL export.

My $0.02,
Jean-Paul

Very cool thing, but it looks to me that those digital joints are for
superman, not for human being. :) (or if you are human with a CNC). Some of
them don't even make sense, if you look closely, either it seems to leave
gaps, or the geometry doesn't seem to allow them to join together, unless
they have magic that I don't see. 

For the purpose of designing joints with Openscad, I would suggest choosing
those that are more commonly used by woodworkers, like those in :

@Pascal, really cool thing you did there. Although I tend to agree with
Jean-Paul that this would probably be a plug-in (user-space lib) instead of
being the core, exploring more directions of application is, IMHO, always a
good thing. 

If I have time in the future, I'd like to develop a 3D CNC and use Openscad
to carve some 3D wood objects for me ... far, far dream ...

Hi Jean-Paul,

I understand your point of view as it is possible to do 3D printing from 
STL export for example. Unfortunately it is quite hard to do proper 
generation of G-Code from STL for CNC milling machine, hence the need of 
a more CNC friendly modeling tool. This carving 'plugin' proposes a way 
of modeling object with no restriction of the usage, but this way of 
modeling offers the possibility to do clean export of G-Code for CNC.

The notion of 'plugin' is a bit blurred today, but I agree that this 
carving plugin is not a core functionality of OpenSCAD. A way to enable 
this functionality at runtime (via the notion of feature maybe?) would 
make sense.

Hi Runsun,

Actually I started with a user-space library :-). Unfortunately I 
quickly reached a wall due to the complexity of the algorithms, hence 
the creation of this c++ plugin. However the fact that it is a c++ 
plugin (still a blurry definition :p) does not make it 'core' as it 
could simply not disabled by default, with a preference activating it 
for example.

In my Lasercut work I have used Ponoko a lot - they use SVG direct from 
Inkscape.
In my extensions for Inkscape (jigsaw, tabbed box)I have added a Kerf 
parameter as well. This is useful to get perfectly fitted parts. The 
offset for the kerf has to be calculated carefully for internal and 
external edges so the parts fit perfectly but maintain their correct 
outer dimensions.
Do you think it would be a useful feature to add ?

Also - because I have kerf - sometimes the user doesn't want that and 
prefers a sloppy fit but with a minimal number of cuts (lowest cost).
I.e. so the pieces are placed directly adjacent to each other and only a 
single line is put into the export file. So no double lines to cut the 
same edge. This lowers the cost of lasercutting quite a lot for most 
pieces but of course its a tradeoff with the sloppy fit.

Have you considered this in your fit and export options also ?

One more option I added was the ability to put in small half round so 
that the sloppy fit pieces could be press fitted. This is no good for 
perspex which cracks but perfect for wood which can sustain minor 
deformation.

Looks really interesting so far. Nice work.
Cheers...

@ Pascal, I see. I think I understand the wall you are talking about. 

Is it fair to say that your modification to the Openscad itself is to allow
Openscad to take your plugin ? This gives me an idea: maybe "requesting the
plugin capability" is a better approach than "requesting the plugin
capability to take specific plugin" like yours ? 

I imagine that a "general plugin capability" would be more acceptable to the
development team and the community.

Hi Runsun,

Yes, the reason I am sharing this work on the carving plugin now is 
exactly to have those kind of discussion.

The notion of plugin, in a strict sense suggest that OpenSCAD should 
have a public API for plugins and link them dynamically or at runtime. I 
expect it is a complex work (definition of the API, implementation of 
the loading mechanism) and will add constraints to OpenSCAD architecture 
and development to keep the API and its implementation stable.

A lighter interpretation could be to define a "carving feature" which 
can be activated at runtime.

I think that's currently not possible, at least not without additional
postprocessing. The 2D behavior matches the one from 3D where touching
parts are unioned into a single one, so a line separating two 2D objects
(e.g. "square(10); translate([10, 0]) square(10);" will just result
in a single 10x20 rectangle).

I guess the interesting question is how to integrate better lasercut
support into the language without breaking existing models.

ciao,
  Torsten.

No. For the reasons stated by tp3. I have only used Ponoko a few times, and
found the saving for single lines not worth the effort and cost of making a
mistake. (But the pricing model may have changed since ~2012)

Could you explain in more detail or point towards an image/example. Should
be easy to add.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Proposal: Add a split command
Message-ID: <CAMyDR6LOMxrbjmqgtiejo5Wozn05JCvVitf2Yg7BgzdV1BjRKA@mail.gmail.com>

I have created lots of real-world items with the 3d printer, using OpenSCAD.
And I just love it.

A lot of the stuff I build, winds up having to be printed with "rafts" or
"supports". It is ugly, and very time consuming to break off all that stuff
to get the final product.

Proposal: If after building something fairly complicated (that I know will
require rafts or supports), I could SPLIT it in half, I would in a lot of
cases eliminate the need for rafts or supports at all. It could be split
horizontally along the x-y plane, at some Z. Like split($children, z=4). Or
split vertically along x-z plane, at some Y. Like split($children, y=6). Or
something. I don't know if I am making any sense here. It has been a long
day.

What I have been doing is building something, and then having to go back
and try to "split" it up myself, painstakingly!

Am I wrong to want this? Or is there something that I have not seen, that
is already there in openSCAD?

Thanks,

Jerry

I do this already. Just wrap an interstection() around a union() of
everything in your model, and use a large cube to chop out the part you
need. allows you to cut-up or split a model using any geometry mask you
wish.

Example

// example split on yz plane, first part

intersection(){
        union(){
             ...... my model here .......
        }
        translate([-50,0,0])
                cube([100,200,200], center=yes);
}

// second part

intersection(){
        union(){
             ...... my model here .......
        }
        translate([50,0,0])
                cube([100,200,200], center=yes);
}

I tried it! beautiful solution! now I have found a use for the
intersection().

$fn = 60;

module myobj() {
  difference() {
    cylinder(h=10, r=10, center=true);
    rotate([0,90,0]) cylinder(h=25, r=5, center=true);
  }
}

// put an explanation point just before the keyword "intersection" to
// display either the top half or the bottom half.

// top half
intersection() {
    myobj();
    translate([0, 0, 25]) cube([200,50,50], center=true);
}

// bottom half
intersection() {
    myobj();
    translate([0, 0, -25]) cube([200,50,50], center=true);
}

There's also a write.scad version that is based on the text() builtin:

I've found an hitch with this project. Netfabb basic is necessary to correct
many complex STL's, and it doesn't support color. So if I arranged colors in
openscad they would be erased when fixing the STL with netfabb, and most of
us use basic version because consumer version costs 230.

I rarely need to fix OpenSCAD STL files.  Perhaps you need to refine 
your code?

There's no export format yet, where OpenSCAD supports colors (well, except
PNG, but I guess that does not count :-). So that's not much of an issue
yet.

At any rate, STL itself does not support any way of specifying colors,
so no program can support that without tricks like having multiple STL
files for different colors.

One option would be to use the newer AMF format which is supposed to
be STL 2.0. (they even use http://stl2.org/ as main web site).

Note that that one still uses assign( ) and needs a lot of re-write.

Does there already exist the possibility to add center=true to centre the text?  If not, I would find this immensely helpful.

There is halign and valign which work based on the font properties
(the sizes defined for the glyphs in the font file).

There's currently no center that's based on the generated mesh vertices.

For mesh based positioning, I think something more general might be
useful, like an align() or pos(). There's an (meanwhile quite old)
pull request on github which has a pos() implementation, but that's
embedded in a huge change with lots of other stuff.

Similar to hull() or minkowski() this would have the side effect of
forcing the mesh calculation up to that point in the object tree so
it would have quite some impact on preview performance.

ciao,
  Torsten.

When I need to fit an arbitrary-sized piece of text, I use the resize() function to bound either the width or the length (not both, to preserve the aspect ratio) of text(valign=?center?,halign=?center,?) and (re)position accordingly.

Thanks Andrew and Torsten.  

Torsten, how do I invoke halign and valign please?

Andrew, I will try your suggestion - as it?s the main way I use text, and the resizing function is also useful, I will try to make a utility module and post it back here...

Sorry i meant encoding to a color .x3d. Some kinds of 3d i have errors, when
alot of objects are union i get errors. Here is a color x3d made from an
openscad file, It's from a random platonic weird algorythm, i thought it was
very cool, unfortunately all the resulting random shapes are made of radial
patterns which are aesthetically absurdist and mathematical and not human :\
I colored this in another program using color relative to the angles of the
shapes. I am getting errors on most of these files stl files, then i fix
them in netfabb and use unity3d to color them in and save as x3d files. It's
viewable in meshlab.

Here is a blowup of some oversize dimples on a tabbed box.
In my extension I made their size based on the Kerf parameter as its serves
a similar purpose.
The Dimple shape here is a flattened oval. When printed in wood the dimple
will crush a little and ensure a press fit.
I also have a design option where this is a triangle. This shape can crush a
lot more. Still no good for Acrylic. Only useful for Wood and Cardboard.
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n14174/2igk328.jpg> 

As an aside - Ponoko's costs are based on the material and the lasertime. So
removing all double lines can make quite an impact on the laser side of the
costs. However its also critical to arrange the svg entities in order of
minimal distance travelled by the laser as it traverses the pattern. This is
not a Ponoko specific issue - it applies to all lasercutting.
However there is no support in inkscape for this CAM type of reordering and
so minimal lines might not show a significant cost reduction if the line
traversal is pathological.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Hollow or solid model?
Message-ID: <1445419921233-14175.post@n5.nabble.com>

I made the following polyhedron:

p1 = [10,10,0];
p2 = [10,-10,0];
p3 = [-10,-10,0];
p4 = [-10,10,0];
p5 = [0,0,15];

[2,3,4], [3,0,4], [0,1,2,3] ]);

Is there a way that we can know if the above object when printed, will be
hollow or filled?
If it is hollow, how to fill it?

Is cube(10) hollow or solid?

Thanks

like Paul Torsten said, the model is solid.

We have a MakerBot at the library, where I print stuff.
There is a parameter called infill that has a percentage number. The higher
the number the denser the object will be.

Now add holes for alignment pins, so you can glue the parts back 
together with perfect registration:

Given a split parallel to the 3D printed layers and a deft glue job, you 
probably won't even notice the joint...

Subject: [OpenSCAD] A mental model of OpenSCAD under the covers
Message-ID: <1445466784431-14180.post@n5.nabble.com>

One of my missions is to educate people about OpenSCAD.  I am an EE and I
like to have a model in my head about how things work.  And I believe models
are helpful for everyone.  I went into embedded systems and over to the
other side and do a lot of software development.  I have models in my head
of what various procedural and OO languages do under the covers.  OpenSCAD
does not fit those models and I have developed a model which helps me
visualize what is happening.  I am also using it to teach others.

I want to run this model by the group and get feedback on how accurate it is
and how to improve it.

The manual mentions a two step compile.  I am visualizing something like a 2
1/2 step compile.  In my model, OpenSCAD first goes through and generates a
CSG tree.  During this step it is following the various conditional branches
(ifs, for loops, etc.) and creating various parts of the tree.  The 1/2
compile is that in each of these "scopes" it evaluates the user controlled
values first and then does the generation of the tree for that branch. (This
is the source of the rule of last value applies to all in a given scope).

The second step is taking the generated tree and producing the tessellated
mesh or preview rendering.  That generated tree has all the user controlled
values determined.  I believe the menu choice "Design - Display CSG Tree..."
shows the intermediate tree after the 1st compile pass.

The 2nd pass is really the core of the OpenSCAD language and is what makes
it different from any other language (unless you call CSG a language).  That
pass is clearly not procedural and understanding that is a big help in
visualizing what one's goal is in writing an OpenSCAD script.

The script we write is taking various tree segments and directing the 1st
(and 1/2) pass on how to put those segments together.  These instructions
are sort of procedural (if, for loops, etc. are procedural), but the
procedure is to create the tree to be realized in the 2nd pass.

Hi Steve,

I sometimes think of what you call the CSG Tree as a DOM - similar to the HTML DOM; It?s a hierarchical data structure describing one explicit design. This is what you can export as a .csg file - which happens to be valid OpenSCAD source code.
This DOM can be rendered in various ways (Preview using OpenCSG, Render using CGAL, Throwntogether using pure OpenGL), so it can be looked at as any other data model in an MVC framework.

The first step doesn?t really consist of half steps. We simply create an AST from the source code and walk that tree evaluating it, resolving any user-defined data in-line. The ?feature? that the last variable survives is an unfortunate hack which allows us to override variables on the cmd-line (but due to widespread use we?ve chosen to be backwards compatible so far).

This diagram could be better, but might help visualize what?s going on:
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/blob/master/doc/OpenSCAD-compile.pdf

Hope that helped,

 -Marius

Hi Marius,

Thank you.  I had looked at that pdf, but didn't quite get it.  Now I
understand better.  So one could safely say that there is a 3 step process. 
Parsing the script into AST, evaluating the AST into CSG and rendering the
CSG in one of three ways.  One could say that a script is a set of
instructions to build a data model representing the desired 3D model.

I teach classes in OpenSCAD at the Tampa Hackerspace.  I am finding that
explaining what happens under the covers has a lot of impact on getting
noobies up to speed.  I can emphasize that variables are to define things in
the model.  And that they have their own syntax.  That the only conditional
that operates with variables is the tertiary operator.  The other
conditionals (if, fors, etc) only operate on the data model.  I seems to
help greatly to get them thinking about two different syntaxes.  The syntax
for variables and math and the syntax for controlling the creation of the
tree (which I will now sell as a data model).

I am feeling like the light is going on behind more of the eyes I see.  I am
now going deeper into using OpenSCAD in my introductory classes and seeing
more people grasping the concepts.

I hope my students recognize the multiple reasons why the following does not
work. (From another question on the forum).

    if (form>1) {form=1};

Steve

BTW, I am a big fan of OpenSCAD.  The last release was huge.  The value of
List Comprehensions is obvious.  But I am finding a little thing like the
LET is greatly improving my code.  Thank you for all your work.

Hi again Steve,

We can look at this another way as well; why some syntax only works on values and other syntax work on the "data model?.
Doug (who might be reading and offer clarification) once came up with what he calls smth. like  ?two-level language syntax?.
The idea is that OpenSCAD source code is really two syntaxes in one:
1) one syntax for describing the DOM (the CSG tree). This builds a data structure in-line by having all modules instantiate themselves (modules are things like union, sphere, if, for, hull etc.).
2) one syntax for describing simple values (not really a language but an expression engine including user-defined expressions)

.csg files contain only syntax 2), but .scad files can have both.
These two syntaxes are different (but similar) ..and in your original email you?re right in that all values need to be evaluated before instantiating each module (as modules take values as parameter).
Now, this is all how OpenSCAD, as a minimal language, was designed, which is also why we don?t support things like function and module references.

If you look at the working document for OpenSCAD2 (https://github.com/doug-moen/openscad2), this is described in at lot more detail :)

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Illustrator OpenSCAD Export Script
Message-ID: <1445562014381-14184.post@n5.nabble.com>

I have written an improved version of JK Keller's
(https://github.com/jk-keller) OpenSCAD export script that supports many
useful options for those folks who frequently use Illustrator to design
things for use in OpenSCAD. The script generates modules for each shape,
bounds and center information, supports compound shapes and groups, and file
export.

It's available here for anyone who's interested:
https://github.com/Yona-Appletree/Adobe-Scripts/blob/master/illustrator_translators/paths_to_scad.jsx

Please do let me know if you encounter any problems with it.

Best,

Yona

As Marius says, OpenSCAD has what I call a two level syntax.

   - The expression syntax is used for computing values. Eg, 2+2, sin(x)
   - The 'statement' syntax is used for computing shapes. Eg, cube(10), if,
   for, {...} etc


OpenSCAD is not a procedural language. This is important for the mental
model. It *looks* like a procedural language, since the statement syntax is
stolen from C, but it isn't, and this is a source of confusion.

In a procedural language, you have mutable variables, and mutable data
structures. When a statement is executed, it doesn't return a value,
instead it modifies state (eg, incrementing a variable or appending a value
to a list).

In OpenSCAD, we don't have mutable variables or mutable data structures. If
you use the word "procedural" to describe OpenSCAD, you are setting up the
expectation that we do have these features, and we don't.

In OpenSCAD, "statement" syntax is really just another kind of expression
syntax, for computing shapes. Statements are really shape expressions. The
"if" statement is the analog of the "? :" operator in the expression
syntax--it returns a shape instead of returning a value. The "for"
statement is the analog of the "for" expression in a list comprehension--it
is essentially a group comprehension, where "group" is the analog of "list"
in the shape world. A group is an ordered sequence of shapes. The {...}
statement has tricky semantics, but in the common case it is just a group
literal, analogous to [...] in the expression syntax.

I tend to think of openscad as being like "javascript with a 3d DOM"

given all tbe available tools for js, it would be possibly a good future
direction to switch to javascript as a potential carrier language for the
csg tree builder.

"Switching" to JavaScript would really mean recreating OpenSCAD from
scratch in JavaScript. Which has already been done. See openjscad.org

Different thing, openjscad is an interpreter for the current openscad
language written in js,  i was suggesting that it may be worth exploring
using javascript itself as the base language instead of tbe current
openscad language. It would require a language level binding to the csg
model.

But that's exactly what openjscad is. Go to http://openjscad.org/ and check
out the example program in the upper right corner. That is javascript, not
openscad.

But in addition to providing a javascript binding for the openscad
operations, you are right, it is also able to read openscad source files.

echo(2/0, atan(2/0), atan(90));
returns
ECHO: inf, 90, 89.3634

The proper response for a division by zero should be not-a-number (NaN),
since that division may result in any number. Consider sin(0)/0=0, which is
a valid expression since the limit for xapproaching zero exists.
atan(2/0) should result in undefined, and atan(90) should result in inf,
since the respective Taylor series does not converge and no value can be
computed.

By the way, is there a means to properly display a formula like
binom{limit}{x rightarrow 0} {sin( x)} over {x} = 0
when posting?

My 2 cents:

To me an OpenSCAD file is a description that when evaluated results in a CSG
tree.
So while it has similar constructs to a programming language, like variable
assignments and if statements, it evaluates once and the result is an
object.

A programming language - if doing this task (like the javascript version) -
creates a CSG tree as a side effect of the program running. So its
statements and loops etc operate "normally".

We could draw another analogy. VHDL and Verilog are programming languages
for hardware. They don't evaluate the same way as programming languages
either. In fact they are quite similar to OpenSCAD but they have their own
special aspects like clock cycles.

This isn't a discussion about whether OpenSCAD should be done one way or the
other. But I would note that there are specific advantages and disadvantages
to each approach. Similary for H/W description languages like VHDL which is
why they exist at all.

The IEEE floating point standard says that 2/0 is inf, and that's the
standard we are following. While your argument for NaN is mathematically
correct, at least where real numbers or exact arithmetic is concerned,
floating point computation doesn't have the same behaviour as real number
arithmetic. For example, it has underflow, where a sufficiently small
positive result is represented by 0, and a sufficiently small negative
result is represented by -0, which is different from 0 in IEEE floats. So
the floating point number 0 sometimes represents a true 0, and it sometimes
represents a very small positive real number. So the IEEE float standards
committee decided to define 1/0 as inf and -1/0 as -inf, and this results
in useful behaviour, making it easier to write floating point code, in a
lot of cases. And yes, this is a compromise, since it's not the right

atan(90) is not infinite, it is close to 90 degrees as is the atan of any
large number. It approaches 90 asymptotically.

tan(90) is definitely infinite, so inf is correct.

echo(atan(tan(90))); gives 90 as it should.

Only 0/0 is undefined and that does give nan.

The manual has been updated.

https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Mathematical_Functions#Infinitudes_and_NaNs

Interesting note.... OpenSCAD seems to return 'undef' for exp(2,1/0) but
it is probably intended to be returning NaN....

exp(x) is a function that takes exactly one argument. It's probably using
generic code to return undef if the number of arguments is incorrect. Which
is fine.

undef and NaN play exactly the same role in the language. Rather than
debate when to return undef and when to return nan in a bunch of different
cases, I'd rather just unify them into a single value.

If you were trying to test ?2^(1/0)? then the function you want is pow(2,1/0).

echo( exp(1/0) );
-> inf
echo( pow(2,1/0) );
-> inf

I am not sure undef and nan are the same. If I don't define x but use it
then it is undefined. x = 0/0 is different because x is defined but
mathematically not a number.

Just to throw in a philosophical angle to another thread discussing how 
to deal with the limits of trigonometric and arithmetic functions:

Mathematics (IMHO) in its purest form is values free, but as soon as it 
is applied to the real world, there has to be some judgments applied, as 
to when and how it is applied.  Consequently any transition from the 
theoretical (eg infinity) to get to a 3-D printed model that I can hold 
in my hand (and not just in my head) is going to require many judgments 
and compromises. OpenSCAD is a perfect example when applying pure 
mathematical concepts to practically rendering 3-D objects on the 
screen, and later into machinable shapes.

I am a retired Maths/Science/Technology teacher, and now I would just 
HAVE to have openSCAD and a 3-D printer in my classroom (s). The 
conversations in this forum are very helpful to my understanding of the 
scope of openSCAD.  The convergence of theoretical maths being applied 
so directly to real world challenges, and at a level that people can 
access relatively easily, is just a fantastic teaching learning 
opportunity.  The positive and constructive critique in this discussion 
list of the openSCAD system encourages me to look forward to more 
improvements in operation and documentation.

I no longer feel condemned to the daily paper's crossword or Sudoku 
puzzle to keep my brain in trim.  OpenSCAD is the perfect reply to the 
often asked question in Mathematics classes "When are we ever going to 
use this again Sir??"  Thank you folks!

You're confusing multiple different function classes. The value X/0 is
an indeterminate form if X is equal to 0. If X oscillates at the limit
between a positive and negative number, then the value is also
indeterminate. In all other cases (and especially where X is constant)
the value will diverge to positive infinity for positive X, and
negative infinity for negative X.

The following forms are typically considered indeterminate at the
limit, where one part of the value diverges in an opposing direction
from the other part:

0/0, ?/?, 0 ? ?, ? ? ?, 0^0, 1^? and ?^0

The value of these forms cannot be determined without an understanding
of the equation that led to these values at the limit. Something that
doesn't have one of these forms is much less likely to be indeterminate.

More information here on Wikipedia:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminate_form

However, the atan(2/0) statement is interesting:

> atan(2/0) should result in undefined

This is *not* undefined in the usual interpretation of the function,
and should be 90?. It just happens that most functions for atan don't
allow for infinite arguments.

To be pedantic, the atan function is strictly indeterminate for *all*
values because a single argument can correspond to two angles 180?
opposed from each other (as well as cycles of 360?). For example, you
could argue that atan(2/0) takes both -90? and 90? as a result. Such a
function would not be particularly useful, so the output domain of the
function is usually set to return results within a particular range,
e.g. [0?,180?), with the remainder of the calculations left as an
exercise for the reader.

Many programming languages (including OpenSCAD) provide a work around
for the issue of infinite values as atan arguments, as well as the 180?
indeterminism, by using the atan2(y,x) function.

nan and undef are both used as the return value from a function, when an
argument is passed that is outside the domain of the function. In this
context, they have the same meaning, but we aren't consistent about whether
we return nan or undef.

len(x) is only defined if x is a string or list, so len(42) == undef.

asin(x) is only defined if x is a number in the range [-1...+1].
asin(2) is nan, but asin("foo") is undef.

foo[i] is only defined if foo is a string or list, and i is an integer in
the range [0...len(foo)-1].
"abc"[0] == "a"
"abc"[42] == undef

I am not sure undef and nan are the same. If I don't define x but use it then it is undefined. x = 0/0 is different because x is defined but mathematically not a number.

undef and NaN play exactly the same role in the language. Rather than debate when to return undef and when to return nan in a bunch of different cases, I'd rather just unify them into a single value.

Interesting note.... OpenSCAD seems to return 'undef' for exp(2,1/0) but it is probably intended to be returning NaN....

tan(90) is definitely infinite, so inf is correct.

echo(atan(tan(90))); gives 90 as it should.


Only 0/0 is undefined and that does give nan.

While your argument for NaN is mathematically correct, at least where real numbers or exact arithmetic is concerned, floating point computation doesn't have the same behaviour as real number arithmetic. For example, it has underflow, where a sufficiently small positive result is represented by 0, and a sufficiently small negative result is represented by -0, which is different from 0 in IEEE floats.

The proper response for a division by zero should be not-a-number (NaN),

since that division may result in any number. Consider sin(0)/0=0, which is

a valid expression since the limit for xapproaching zero exists.

atan(2/0) should result in undefined, and atan(90) should result in inf,

since the respective Taylor series does not converge and no value can be

computed.

?
By the way, is there a means to properly display a formula like

binom{limit}{x rightarrow 0} {sin( x)} over {x} = 0

when posting?

IEEE 754 does lay down rules on how to deal with situations that High-School
mathematics does not cover, such as division-by-zero in a context of
*finite* calculation accuracy (My training in High-School maths always
assumed *infinite* accuracy). To  quote
<https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/ieee754status/IEEE754.PDF>  :

"Exception: DIVIDE by ZERO
This is a misnomer perpetrated for historical reasons. A better name for
this exception is
"Infinite result computed Exactly from Finite operands."
An example is 3.0/0.0, for which IEEE 754 specifies an Infinity as the
default result." Unquote.

This 30 page paper discusses what to report in case of an over- or
underflow, the range of opinions that (have) exist(ed) on the action to be
taken and how unequally this has been implemented historically. Interesting
reading.
Unequal implementation over different hardware is what I experienced, and
reported as a bug. Let's stick to IEEE754.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] $fe - Tolerance based arc approximation
Message-ID: <1445765469224-14212.post@n5.nabble.com>

Objects such as cubes are precise when rendered, but objects such as
cylinders are not because the circular arc has to be approximated by facets. 
This approximation process is controlled by the special variables $fa, $fs &
$fn.

Having come to OpenSCAD primarily from a design engineering background I am
used to specifying tolerances for specific features, e.g. 20mm +/- 0.1mm.
Wanting to use this principle for arc approximation I have adopted the
approach set out below which I hope might be useful to others.

The maximum error for a facet occurs at it centre, when it is furthest from
the true circular arc that it approximates. I use variable $fe in my
OpenSCAD scripts to specify the maximum acceptable value of this error (the
distance from the centre of the facet to the true circular arc, measured
normal to the facet).  I then use the following function to calculate a
value for $fa based on the arc radius and $fe:

// if $fn>0 it takes priority, returns 360/$fn
// if $fe<=0 or is undefined, returns $fa
// never returns more than 45 deg => circle -> octagon (if $fe>0 and
!($fn>0))
// Note $fs must be set to a small value so that it has no effect (does not
override $fa)
function
fa(r)=($fn>0)?360/$fn:($fe>0)?($fe<r)?min(45,2*acos(1-$fe/r)):45:$fa;

$fa, $fs &amp; $fn need to be set such that the value for $fa calculated by
fa() is always used, my typical script header is:

$fs=0.01; // small => generally no effect
$fn=undef; // => ignored
$fa=360/5; // large, but not used, identifies errors where $fa not set &
passed

Examples:
1) a cylinder with radius 20mm and tolerance +/-0.1mm is coded as:

$fe=0.1; // acceptable error dimension, arc facets to true arc path
r=20;
cylinder(r=r,h=20,$fa=fa(r)); 

2) a torus:

$fe=0.1; // acceptable error dimension, arc facets to true arc path
major_r=40;
minor_r=20;
rotate_extrude($fa=fa(major_r+minor_r)) translate([major_r,0,0])
circle(minor_r,$fa=fa(minor_r)); 

3) $fe can also be adjusted for specific objects within a model (rough
cylinder with accurate bore):

$fe=0.5; // acceptable error dimension, arc facets to true arc path
r1=40;
r2=20;
h=20;
difference(){
cylinder(r=r1,h=h,center=true,$fa=fa(r1));
cylinder(r=r2,h=h+1,center=true,$fa=fa(r2,$fe=0.1));
}
// Note: The new value for $fe is explicitly passed to function fa() not to
cylinder().
// Coding as cylinder(r=r2,h=h+1,center=true,$fe=0.1,$fa=fa(r2)); is
unreliable,
//   it is unclear which value for $fe is within scope when fa(r2) is
evaluated 


Having coded curved objects like this, the number of facets will
automatically adjust to keep the object within tolerance if the dimension
parameters are changed.

This method produces a mesh that is within the desired tolerance, but this
takes no account of the tolerance of any machine that might be used to
produce the object.

It is defined in the programming sense. It has been given a value that is
undefined in the mathematical sense represented by nan. That is different
to using a variable that has never been assigned.

I think the compiler should report a fatal error message if there is a
reference to an unassigned variable.

Right now, we only report a warning for this. I've seen 4 or 5 forum posts
where people can't understand what their program is doing in this
situation. The warning is there, but they kind of skim over that and go to
the forum for help. There's also a couple pages in the manual about the
horribly unintuitive behaviour that results when you include a file and you
also have references to unassigned variables. Just make it an error and
this source of confusion will go away.

The problem is backwards compatibility. I have things like this at the
moment:

exploded = $exploded == undef ? 0 : $exploded; // 1 for exploded view

Have you ever considered a tapered dovetail? That is an old trick among
woodworkers - takes a bit more skill to do it than plain finger joints.
Laser cutters are advertised to be capable to tilt these days.

My first question would be, can the user run "openscad --info" from the
command line?

Hello,

Any chance rotate_extrude might be extended with vertical motion, in order
to make helixes?
I can imagine something workable with the following parameters:
- amount of vertical movement per rotation
- total number of rotations. 

So if you start with a circle of diameter 1 (like for a donut) but move 2
units upwards per rotation, you get a helix with a "fill factor" of 0.5.

Implementation can be done with 2 triangular polygon per area where normally
(on a donut or so) would be 1 trapezoid polygon. I'm sorry if I don't use
the proper terms exactly, I'm not an expert in this field.

Joris

There's linear_extrude with the twist parameter, and then there's sweep() which
gives you generalized extrusion with certain transformations. If you look at the
commit log of github.com/openscad/MCAD's fasteners/threads.scad library, you'll
see an implementation I did using linear_extrude with twist, and the current one
that uses sweep.

linear_extrude with twist generated okay meshes as long as you lined up your
facets with the twist slice back in an older version of OpenSCAD, but looks
terrible now. See https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/901.

Sorry, forgot to mention that it's in the dev branch, so

Actually, that dis-assembly and stack is for the 2015.03-1 build. The
2015.10.17 version crashes in similar code at address 0000000000F903F4 :
 mov         rax,qword ptr [rdx] .

I understand you can make similar things with linear_extrude. But the polygons will be 
completely different and it will not look nearly as good. If you use linear_extrude with a lot of 
rotations, the polygons will be very long stretched. You don't want this on threads. Many more 
polygons are then needed to create something that looks reasonable acceptable. Rendering 
times are 10 times what is actually be needed. And still it's not really good.

Also, conceptually, it is a different way of creating things. In the real world, extrusion 
machines don't make threads, and there's a good reason for it: the angle cannot be that 
great. To make a thread, you would place a shape at 90 degrees onto the work, like a cutter 
on a lathe. You are shaping from a different angle.

The thread library is very nice, but the library could also be a lot easier if this type of rotating 
extrusion would be natively supported. You would only need to use the following code to 
make a nearly perfect thread:

module metric_thread( diameter, length, pitch );
  intersection() {
    translate( [0, 0, -pitch] ) 
      // create a thread from a polygon
      rotate_extrude( pitch=pitch, rotations=length/pitch+2 )
        polygon( points=[
          [0,0], 
          [diameter,0], 
          [diameter, pitch*1/16],
          [diameter-5/16*sqrt(3)*pitch, pitch*6/16],
          [diameter-5/16*sqrt(3)*pitch, pitch*10/16],
          [diameter, pitch*15/16],
          [diameter, pitch],
          [0, pitch], ] );
    // cut off the thread at top and bottom by intersecting with this cube
    translate( [-diameter/2, -diameter/2,0] )
      cube( [diameter,diameter,length] );
  }    
}

This snippet could possibly be abstracted out into a module to do what you want.

I like the idea of modifying rotate_extrude to allow for building helixes, although it?s a step backwards from providing more general extrusion functionality..

Yeah they're in need of cleanup in that aspect and in others as well. Work's
ongoing in the dev branch.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Animation external control
Message-ID: <1446021822594-14234.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hello,

I try to integrate OpenScad with my product.
The aim is to control OpenScad animation from an external program.

This program produces somes variables, updates them in time, like angle of a
beam.
I want to see in OpenScad a moving beam with angle corresponding to the
variable

How can connect an external program to control OpenScad variables and
animation ?
If variables are not accessible it could be only control $t from external,
or just control animation widget or by CLI...
I could even develop some code but I need some advices...

What can be done ?

a+
Vicnet

I just found out extrusion of a loop using hull. It's very cool. Openscad is
so awesome, that 3 lines can litteraly make a polygon extrusion code which
took me 2 days to code in triangles arrays. 

So, the hull can't handle 2d polygons. Damn, it processes twice as many
vertices, yes it's kindof slow. 

So the solution would be to take the polygons, and generate a new set of
quads joining every 2 points in the polygon. perhaps is possible. will see.
it's the best solution currently.

This code might help get you started, but the output from OpenSCAD is saved

Ok, so some digging around has revealed a gem called runsun's faces.scad
toolkit with chain polygons module...

Chain takes a set of polygons and chains them togeter same as extrude. it's
exactly what we need.

I'm checking out how easy it is to take an array of matrix positions of
cubes, and use squares instead to extrude that. Not that trivial, however
someone with a less zombie brain than me can probably figure out the handles
to change the array of polygons into an array of multimatrix rotations. hm.
cool code. it's here:

great. I am not privy to when the assign() statement will no longer be in a
future release.

I have found something in Thingiverse that I like. And it has assigns in
there. Is there a recommended method to get rid of the assign's?
(Just leave off the assign? like: assign(x=3) ==> x == 3? or what?

Check out this thread: 
http://forum.openscad.org/Animating-gif-with-3D-rotation-td14011.html
<http://forum.openscad.org/Animating-gif-with-3D-rotation-td14011.html>  

Especially  this post
<http://forum.openscad.org/Animating-gif-with-3D-rotation-tp14011p14029.html>  
in which a python script runscad.py (see my signature below) is used to run
OpenScad in console to produce animation gifs. 

This is not controlling an opened Openscad with external program as what you
described, but might give you some idea. 

Another approach is to save your variables in a .scad file and use it or
include it as usual.

This:

blah () {
    assign (x = 3) {
        something ();
    }
}

becomes

blah () {
     x = 3;
     something ();
}

Hello

A .zip package of an alternative build, using the MSYS2 Build System,
   has been uploaded here (note it is rather large, >50MB)::

http://files.openscad.org/snapshots/OpenSCAD-2015.10.28-x86-64.msys2.zip

Also this build has sprinkled openscad.cc with several debug print
statements.  Running this might help diagnose the problems...

Hello,

I check the source code and update of $t is quite similar to modify source
code and reload it.
When animation is run, $t is updated, and source is get from editor and
recompiled.
Except file loading, it is the same thing (get text and compile) with
auto-reload function if var are modified in scad source directly.

Thanks for the debug build.
It gets a bit further.
Running openscad results in the error message in the attached screen shot
before it terminates.

The openscad --info command now gives:

Admittedly a rather late reply, but perhaps you could code like this:

t1=$t*2-1;

To improve animation on bigger model or to be faster, OpenScad should cache

How about this?

//=================
$fa=1;
$fs=1;

difference(){
cylinder(r=5, h=20, center=true);
union(){
difference(){
cylinder(r=2, h=21,center=true);
translate ([15,0,0])
rotate([0,0,45])
cube(21,21,21, center=true);
}
}
}

Hi Don,
I am curious, did you fix an issue, or was it using the MSYS2 build process

Thanks for testing it out, that is good news.

The MSYS2 build and link process is the only real difference between the
versions. This is not a good permanent solution, for example the MSYS2
build required some nasty kludging of MSYS2 windeployqt which is why
there are two identical 25 megabyte ICU .dll files with only a slightly
different name in the download package.
