It is definatly time OpenScad had built in text handling, i generaly have
to resort to exporting polygon sets from inkscape via the superb path to
Openscad exporter. Bringing across text fragments as includable modules,
But its time openscad had a standard way to do this itself, which had
access to the OS font engine, instead of dxf files with exported fonts in
them.

It one of the three things that still piss me off about openscad

1. No text
2. No android app, and before people say thats stupid, i have a 12.2 inch 8
core android tablet.  But some touch capabilities would be cool, like being
able to move , rotate and pitchzoom (scale) the preview window would make
the app double up as a viewer. There is a great port being done called
scorchcad, but its a reimplementation rather than a port. Its in beta in
the play store.
3. Weak STL import (it never seems to work, and when it does, it never
renders right, even with stl's produced by openscad itself), at the very
least it should be able to eat its own dogfood. I dont know if a foreign
mesh is considered as a first class primitive object or not.

Text has been enabled in the development snapshot for a number of months. Will make it into the next official release.

Not planned, but I?d be happy to support development initiatives.

We?re working on this. It?s not trivial due to our solid constraints.

Suggestions for good forum engines are welcome.

The challenge is that admins need an email gateway, and many subscribers
prefer email too as it's a lot easier to filter and respond to than using
web forums.

It doesn't have to be free, just cost effective.
Self-hosting as an option is preferrable. Right now I try to be lean so I
use cheap providers anywhere I can, but we can probably take a hit doing
some sysadmin work to set things up properly on a VPS or smth. as we might
in the future use ads as a way of paying for infrastructure.
Servers will likely run Ubuntu or something similar.

The technical requirement/wish is basically to have a web forum with an
email option, I guess pretty much how google groups or github issues work.

I've tried subscribing before. Tried again now, so we'll see what happens.

I've googled around for some forums now. There are lots of free ones, but
haven't found one which will send all thread posts as e-mails yet.

You know, it's really odd that this subject pops up here right now.

I just built a forum for someone using SMF.  I think it has the email 
functionality you are talking about, or at least part of it.  I've never 
messed with the email stuff myself, at least not yet, so I'm not sure if 
it does everything you want.  You might want to look into that.

It's pretty good as forum software goes.  It certainly is popular.  The 
SMF team uses it as their support forum, of course, and that forum has 
millions of posts in hundreds of thousands of topics by hundreds of 
thousands of users in like fifty languages.

I like it because all of its basic functionality, including posting, 
works fine and looks great even if you're using a script blocker.  Try 
that with Google Groups.

If it does everything you want, it wouldn't be hard to set up.  Maybe an 
hour or so.

I can get you one for nuthin'.

I just checked about this.

The user can ask for email notifications of new posts.  This can be done 
per topic or per board.

By default, a user can't reply to an email and have that show up in the 
forum.  But someone built an extension to do that:

http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=168

It's from about eight years ago, and SMF has had a major upgrade since 
then, so I don't know if it still works.  But all this stuff is open 
source of course.

Anybody good at PHP?

Ignore previous post, here is the mod you want I think:

http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=2843

It's compatible with the latest stable version.  I have not tested this 
mod myself, but it's got a thousand downloads and the latest update is 
from October, so that's a good sign...

You just said the mailing list was down anyways. <- This also applies to
MichaelAtOz trying to help topics reach the mailing list. :)

Can the mailing list be configured to allow emails even from people who
weren't subscribed?

I would strongly recommend Phorum <http://www.phorum.org/>. Reprap's forums
<http://forums.reprap.org/> use it, it is free, and apparently has a complete
2-way forum to mailing list integration system
<http://www.phorum.org/phorum5/read.php?62,140380,140380#msg-140380>.

I use the Reprap forums quite a lot, and I can say with certainty that I
like it waaaay more than vBulletin. Definitely the one I would go for.

Good point (pun unintented). It would need to force a render of this subtree.

Works fine (not slow) with F5 here, but F6 uses more than 3 minutes to
render, which seems unreasonable.

I have noticed version 2014.11.07  often stops working (openccad has stopped
working is what windows tells me") for no reason. This doesn't seem to be
related to any particular piece of code.

I experience the same. Lots of crashes with 2014.11.09. Sometimes a piece of

I looked at both Phorum and SMF a couple weeks ago.  Both are free, and 
Free Software.  Both are written in PHP and use MySQL as a backend.

Both require a mod installation to get full two-way email integration  - 
it's not in the core functionality.

I've used both, and like both (and likewise, like both more than 
vBulletin and some others).  I've never used email with either one, and 
cannot comment on that.

Both are on Github.  I looked at the number of contributors and their 
activity level, and the amount of activity in their respective support 
fora.  SMF has like orders of magnitude more activity.  Phorum has had 
very few commits in the last year or so.  This was what decided me.

I've had SMF running since last weekend.  People are using it.  Have 
never installed Phorum, cannot comment on that.

Since I've already got an instance of SMF running, I'm going to try to 
install the mod for 2-way email, just 'cause I'm curious now.

echo (n(10));

The documentation says Assign: "Set variables to a new value for a sub-tree."

for (i = [10:50])
{
    assign (angle = i*360/20, distance = i*10, r = i*2)
    { // subtree starts here
        rotate(angle, [1, 0, 0])
        translate([0, distance, 0])
        sphere(r = r);
    } // subtree ends here
}

So you can't use it like that.

Please report any such crashes with as much detail as possible.
We?re striving to keep the development snapshots stable, but bugs will creep in. The sooner we learn about them, the sooner we can fix them.
Especially on Windows, as we don?t currently have any devs using Windows as our primary platform.

PS! New dev snapshot out today.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Recursion && Translation
Message-ID: <139F507E-A5C5-42CB-834A-8BFF476CCCBA@kintel.net>

Hi all,

We just put a new dev snapshot online.
Two significant features:

1) Translation support: Translation as in multiple language support. Initially, we support German, with stubs for Czech, French and Russian. Contributions are welcome. Please ask here if you?re interested in contributing and we?ll work out how to best contribute.

2) Better recursion support: We now limit recursion by available stack size instead of using an arbitrary depth. This should mean no more crashes and better support for light-weight deep recursion. Stack usage is improved, and we also now have tail recursion elimination which will convert tail recursions using the ?: operator into loops

Please give both a spin. Bugs are inevitable and if you find any, please report.
Thanks to Don for initiating the translation support and Torsten for spearheading the finalization as well as the tail recursion optimizations.

No, the bumping was because the thread starter had never been subscribed to
the mailing list (new or old).

Is anyone seeing the same in Linux ? If so it might be worth running it
under valgrind to see what that flags up.

It used to...

Last night I did a git pull / compile and discovered that Something 
Changed in the last week or two, as a conditional test that formerly 
worked no longer did.

The original test:
  else if ((!(iy % 2) && !(ix % 2)))

What works now:
  else if ((0 == (iy % 2)) && (0 == (ix % 2)))

The ix and iy integers iterate from 0 to maximum values, generating 
coordinates at discrete points in the plane. At positions where the 
indexes are both even, the program generates a particular type of chain 
mail link.

It seems the ! operator recently stopped turning (integer) 0 into 
(boolean) true, as the result remained obstinately false.

A similar test:
  if ((iy % 2) && (ix % 2))

continues to function properly, generating a different link shape at the 
(odd,odd) points.

The offending conditional is at the bottom of the listing at:

http://softsolder.com/2014/12/04/3d-printed-chain-mail-armor-cosplay-edition/

As the post observes, the code needs refactoring. I recompiled OpenSCAD 
and started fiddling, only to discover half the chain mail links were 
missing...

I did not see just random crashes (on Linux). Pretty much all real crashes
(e.g. OpenSCAD process is killed, not things like "not responding") were
related to either undefined parameters "polygon(points = undef)" or due
to recursion hitting the stack limit (which should be much better in the
latest snapshot).

Running with valgrind is unfortunately not so easy as it requires a special
flag while compilation (-DCGAL_DISABLE_ROUNDING_MATH_CHECK=ON).

ciao,
  Torsten.

Read the emails you got when you subscribed for unsubscribe instructions.
There should also be an option not to receive digests (in other words, you
are allowed to post to the list, but you don't receive emails).

Also:  If one is assuming that one can unsubscribe from a list by 
sending that word in the subject line, which works for some lists, it is 
too much to expect that it will actually work when that word is 
misspelled...

Subject: [OpenSCAD] memory use, 32 bit Linux system, version 2014.10.02
Message-ID: <1417798345338-10374.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hello,

Watching memory usage with Xfce task manager, I first notice that only one
cpu core is in use, and it is saturated. Can multiple cores be used? Second,
my simple little model, a perforated tube geometry, is dying before
rendering is finished, unless I reduce the tube length to about half of what
I need to generate. Memory used does not appear to reach 100% of 4GB, so I'm
guessing this has more to do with fragmentation than real consumption. I
last saw it using about 75%, went away for 10 minutes, and it was crashed
when I returned to check on it. So I'm not "certain" about this, just my
best guess...
Anyone care to comment or have you seen this happening on 64 bit systems?
Thanks,
Bill

Currently that's not possible.

https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/391 is did not succeed in
attracting developers yet ;-).

Without looking at the model, it's hard to guess what the cause could
be. Crashes could be caused by recursion using up the stack (fix for that
is on the way) or it could be due to bad geometry generated, e.g. due
to rounding issues...

ciao,

Yes, there was quite a big change to support the better recursion
handling. I guess that introduced the bug. I'll have a look.

That's right, you need a new version. Get the "Development Snapshot" from the
downloads page.

Maybe there is a neater or faster way of doing sum, but this seems to do the
job:

/*
    sum(vector) - Calculate the sum of all elements in a vector of numbers
*/
function sum(v, i=0) =
    len(v) > i ? v[i] + sum(v, i+1) : 0;

If the list is empty (or the end of the list is reached), return 0. Else,
return the current element plus the sum of the rest of the list.

I would be happy to post the model file, if that is ok for this list. It 
is very small. It is
also my very first model generation attempt! Liking this SCAD program.

Ok, since it is so tiny I'll just paste it inline.
BTW: the t_len variable is desired to be 420mm.

t_len = 105;

h_cc = 6;               //center-to-center perforation spacing
h_dia = 3;              //perforation hole diameter
p_deg = 360/(PI*OD/h_cc);     //degrees between perf holes
n_rot = floor(PI*OD/h_cc) -1;       //inner loop count

//weird, but it does the job!
function O(cnt) = cnt*p_deg/2 ; //rotate around the tube this much 
"extra" each ring segment along length

module perf_tube()
{
     difference() {
         translate( [0, 0, t_len/2] )

         cylinder(h = t_len, d=ID, $fn=100, center = true);
             }
         }

         for ( j = [0 : t_len/seg_h] ) {

Well, that is doing something strange, I'll have to look deeper.
It managed to get OpenSCAD to use 95% of my dual core CPU (and almost hang
the app), which is strange for a non-multi threaded app...

That's strange, I got noheads email (below), but it is not posted here???

I agree, but with $fn=10 everywhere it is still behaving badly.

Ok, thanks for taking a look. I'm not intending to
"manufacture" as in 3-d printing, just create a good mesh file
to input to the SU2 code from Stanford. Once I get the file format
into something SU2 likes...

Current snapshot 2014.12.04  here <http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html> 
, may have some features to handle memory better and performance is better
too.

I'm running Win 7/64 OpenSCAD 64bit, I used the 2014.03 Production Release.

With slightly modified code (incl somewhat lower $fn values), I just did a
t_len = 420, F6 (no F5) it took 2h 14m 38s, and used 1.55GB of memory. That
has 1750 holes and taxes OpenSCAD, F5 is useless and F6 takes a long time.

The export to STL took a few minutes and not much more memory.

Do you want this STL (ie a bit chunkier than yours but looks OK to me)?

I'm going to try refactoring to see if there is a better way.

Message-ID: <1417853484264-10393.post@n5.nabble.com>

Here is the slightly modified code (I haven't done that re factoring yet,
will do tommorrow).

echo(version=version());

t_len = 420;
seg_h = 6;              //6mm tall ring segment
base = seg_h/2;         //get back to zero on Z axis
ID = 48;                //main tube ID
OD = 50;               //main tube OD
h_cc = 6;               //center-to-center perforation spacing
h_dia = 3;              //perforation hole diameter
p_deg = 360/(PI*OD/h_cc);     //degrees between perf holes
n_rot = floor(PI*OD/h_cc) -1;       //inner loop count

fn1=72;
fn2=32;

//weird, but it does the job!
function O(cnt) = cnt*p_deg/2 ; 
//rotate around the tube this much "extra" each ring segment along length

module perf_tube()
{
     difference() {
         translate( [0, 0, t_len/2] )
         union() {
             difference() {
         		cylinder(h = t_len, d=OD, $fn=fn1, center = true);
				translate([0,0,-1]) // cleaner cut
         			cylinder(h = t_len+3, d=ID, $fn=fn1, center = true); // bit
bigger
             }
         }

         for ( j = [0 : t_len/seg_h] ) {
             translate( [0, 0, (j*seg_h) + base] )
             for ( i = [ 0 : n_rot ] ) {
                 rotate( [90, 0, i*p_deg + O(j)] )
                 translate( [0, 0, (ID+OD)/4] )
                 cylinder(h = OD-ID+1, d = h_dia, $fn=fn2, center = true);
             }
          }
      }
}
echo(n_rot=n_rot,t_len=t_len,seg_h=seg_h,t_len/seg_h*n_rot);
perf_tube();

The cleaner cut of the two cylinders removed coincident faces and helped a
bit. But F5 was still stuffed.


The figures in the above post were based on:
fn1=64;
fn2=16;

The above, with higher $fn, on 2014.12.04, F6 took 1h 28m and used 5.8GB!
(on my 4GB system so some swapping involved).

So, for OpenSCAD testing, I'm going to run 2014.03 with the larger $fn
values, as I suspect that memory increase is unexpected.

Do you want the STL?

In answer to your original question, yes you do want to go 64bit, and I'd
suggest min 8GB RAM if feasible. (I'm planning my upgrade ATM). 16GB doesn't
cost much these days. Ands get the fastest single core GHz (in as many cores
as you can afford).

BTW Marius, Nohead, Les (I'm the Michael who introduced you to OpenSCAD BTW -
just changed email addresses), I've now got two emails (from Hophead & Les)
with the title of this post, which do not appear here in Nabble. So either
Nabble is not quite right or Nohead/Les your individual setting on this new
Nabble implementation need adjustment.

Note the new, post crash, forum has default user preferences, you may need
to check your settings.

Yeh I also did the -z/+z bit for the two cylinders difference, helped a bit,
but F5 still stuffed. I have 'average' GPU, and F5 GPU% is ~75% flat-lined
with a refresh rate of around 10 seconds, forever, nasty. (NVIDEA ION
Graphics)


Interim update:

The same higher $fn as above, with 2014.03, is now at 999/1000 for F6, and
has only used 2GB memory, so it looks like 2014.12.04 (and prob earlier)
have 250% memory consumption v's 2014.03. 

Not good.

Standby for final result.

Hi, 
I wish there was a function, for example, annotate("some text") which could
be used to create something like this:

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n10399/thread_drawing.png> 

Example of usage would be;

annotate("M4 nut pocket") cube([3,3,3]);

What do you think?

So, first lesson is that 64bit makes the difference between crashing &
just taking a long time, I first tried this with the 2014.03 32bit release
and crashed, out of "usable" memory. I still suspect it is trashing the 
heap...

I have found that I can make a 48mm long segment with the $fn=100
setting without crashing, using 2014.10.2 that I currently have installed,
so am looking at creating offset segments of this size & stacking them up
in MeshLab. I looked at the first segment in MeshLab and it looks fine.

Much appreciate your taking the time to fiddle with my code, I'm sure
I'll learn a few good tricks from looking at the results.

There doesn't appear to be a 32bit Linux version of 2014.12.04 binary,
looks like I need to build from source to try that. Which is ok...

Heh. I would have to pick a first project that is problematic itself!

Might be OT but if you would like your SCAD file rendered to STL and shown online, Libre3D has adapted to show it.

Note: SCAD files with library plugins aren't supported yet but coming soon :-)

Example below shows a SCAD will render and anyone can download as an SCAD or STL file. The other render is just an uploaded STL for example too.

Maybe it could be done by connecting a line from the center? of the object
to the foreground of the viewing plane? Maybe this could be the start to
making the viewing pane interactable? Maybe you could move stuff around on
the viewing pane with the mouse? Or have a list mode, where all the items
were automatically listed on the right hand side of the drawing, with
automatic text scaling (so that the font would shrink as more and more
items were added). Any annotaate function should have a color variable to
it e.g. color=default (changes color based on color scheme),
color=different (each element annotated is in a different color), e.g.
color="red" (makes line and writing "red".

Final result, 2014.03 with:

fn1=72;
fn2=32; 

Took 3h 23m (no swapping) and 2.85GB.

v's on 2014.12.04, F6 took 1h 28m (some swapping to SSD) and used 5.8GB! 

Double memory again...

The 'More' text upper right of a post, has a drop-down with an edit option.
But as I said, it edits the web post and does not get to the mailing list,
so those who just use the mailing list don't see edits, unless they come
here.

Well, I have more time than memory to burn...the older release looks 
better to me. Building in parts & combining is working, just a few more 
segments to render and I will have my perforated tube created. MeshLab 
is amazing!

The reason you got my email and the forum didn't is because I replied to
you instead of to all. It wasn't necessary to do reply all with the

It may be faster to build the tube in segments and join then in OpenScad as
well because the slow bit is the result of the for loop is unioned before
the difference.

Does it show anything with F6 render?

Try this. It's simplistic, but you should be able to adjust it to do what you're 
looking for.



linear_extrude(h=20, twist=20*90)

{

union()

{

circle(r=15);

polygon([[30,0],[7.5813,13],[7.5813,-13]]);

polygon([[-30,0],[-7.5813,13],[-7.5813,-13]]);

}

}

Yes, I did that in an earlier version, but saw a pattern of missing 
triangles at the join lines between segments. Just recently
got all the segments exported & into MeshLab, joined them all & dumped 
out in .ply format. Hoping to play with SU2 a bit .

Did you overlap then a little? Unioning things that just touch can fail due
to floating point inaccuracies.

He is a electronics/maker type geek (nothing wrong with that) with lots of

This video

at ~7:00, he is a bit over the top, but take your plugs when you can, I

No, and I suspect that was not good. First attempt at this kind of 
thing, learning new tricks as I go along. What I did was to render a 
12mm section of the perforated tube geometry, write that to a .stl file, 
then drop into a loop doing offset(..) & import from .stl until the 
overall length was right. I see that this does leave boundaries with no 
overlap, that well could have been that issue.
Last night I joined a bunch of tube segments end to end with MeshLab, 
and do not see this artifact. Now I have what I initially wanted to 
create, but it has been a fun learning exercise along the way. 'Course 
I'm still quite ignorant about this stuff... :-[
One thing noticed yesterday re. openSCAD behaviour: It insists upon 
hanging on to all the memory used during render...or so it seems. I had 
to quit & restart to get my system memory usage back to "idle" conditions.

In the latest snapshot, the viewport zoom is reset every time I preview or
render. This is really annoying for small/big parts.

Is that orthogonal mode only?

That's probably related to https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/932 /

Rotation is a really difficult issue. The part is rotated around the axis,
not around its own center. So you get different results depending on whether
you translate it before or after rotating. To rotate a part around its own
center, it needs to be placed with its center at 0 on the axes that you want
to rotate around.

rotate([0,20,0])  {
    color("red")
    translate([-3,0,0])
    cube([3,3,3]);

    translate([0, 6, 0])
    cube([3,3,3]);
}

One cube appears to be rotated "up" (red) and the other "down" even though
both were rotated 20*. The difference lies in their initial positions. Be
very observant about where your parts are created, even before you start
translating/rotating.

Rotation is like tying a string from each of the vertices and to the axis
that you are rotating about, then moving the vertices by x degrees.

The direction of rotation is also difficult to predict. I don't use the
right hand rule. Instead I imagine a protractor centered at [0,0,0]. Rotate
the view so that you are "standing" on the POSITIVE side of the axis you are
rotating around and looking towards zero. Imagine (you don't have to imagine
it, as I drew it for us in the code below - I'm definetely saving this for
future use!) the full circle of 360 degrees. If you have an object placed at
120 and rotate it 30 degrees around the x axis it should end up at 150.


module protractor(c) {
    color(c)
    for (i=[0:30:359]) {
        rotate([i, 0, 0])
        translate([0, 100, 0])
        rotate([0,90,0])
        linear_extrude(height=1)
        text(str(i));
        
        rotate([i,0,0])
        translate([0, 0, 10])
        cylinder(h=90, r=0.5);
    }
}

// rotate around the x axis
protractor("red");

// rotate around the y axis
//rotate([0,0,90])
//protractor("chartreuse");

// rotate around the z axis
//rotate([0, 90, 0])
//protractor("blue");

I hope this helps!

Bananapeel :)

You are right, I didn't notice that. In that case it's not such of a large
issue for me. Thank you.

If you can plot out a polygon of the thread profile for the entire length of
rotation in a circular form, you can then linear_extrude it with a certain
amount of twist and height in order to get your screw.

Basically, take a thread profile, plot it on graph paper on an X/Y axis, and
change the X/Y labels to angle/radius, and you've gotten a proper cross-section
for your thread.

I implemented this in https://github.com/openscad/MCAD, in fasteners/thread.scad
in the dev branch.

https://github.com/openscad/MCAD/blob/dev/fasteners/threads.scad#L147 for a
generic trapezoidal thread that can generate buttress, acme, and metric threads.
Doing a tapered thread this way is beyond me, though. I'm thinking of replacing
this approach with the sweep() module from the list comprehension demos, which
would be cleaner and simpler to implement.

You can see why you had to rotate it negatively in the code below (I
exaggerated the rotations to make it easier to see). Also, by exaggerating
the values, an imperfectness with the geometry becomes apparent. The planes
sort of overlap. I'm no expert, but I think it's not going to matter in
practice, because the thickness of the planes covers up the gap (with the
proper rotation values).

module quarterPlane() { 
    color("Blue")
    rotate([22.5, 22.5, 0])
    translate([-23.49,0,0])  // create the part in the other quadrant and
you need to rotate positively to get up towards 30 degrees.
    cube([23.49,19,.02]); 
    
    color("red")  // this is your old part. notice you have to flip it
negatively to rotate the outer edge from 180 towards 150, because 150 is
less than 180
    rotate([22.5, -22.5, 0])
    cube([23.49,19,.02]); 
} 

quarterPlane(); 

module protractor(c) { 
    color(c) 
    for (i=[0:30:359]) { 
        rotate([i, 0, 0]) 
        translate([0, 100, 0]) 
        rotate([0,90,0]) 
        linear_extrude(height=1) 
        text(str(i)); 
        
        rotate([i,0,0]) 
        translate([0, 0, 10]) 
        cylinder(h=90, r=0.5); 
    } 
} 

rotate([0,0,90]) 
protractor("chartreuse");

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Wish - mouseover parts in viewport should highlight code
Message-ID: <1418061192855-10431.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi, I was thinking... When you have a scenario that consists of multiple
parts I find it tedious to find the correct piece of code that created that
part. I usually sprinkle #'s around to try to identify which node is which
by doing a preview each time I move the # to a new piece of code.

So, my idea is - would it be possible to highlight the line of code that
drew the current object I'm mousing over?

Say for instance I have a this script:

cube(10);
translate([15, 10, 10]) sphere(5);

When I move the mouse over the cube in the viewport the first line should be
highlighted. When I move the mousecursor over the sphere, the second line
should be highlighted.

What do you think? Bad idea?

A number of ideas along this line is already listed in the project idea list:

https://github.com/openscad/openscad/wiki/Project%3A-Improve-OpenGL-rendering

I guess we could add some more details there...

Subject: [OpenSCAD] CGAL error in CGAL_Nef_polyhedron3
Message-ID: <1418074555341-10433.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi, 
I've got a model that consists of several parts. I've written most of them,
with one exception, an aluminum extrusion library found here
(http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:136430).

By themselves all parts seems to render just fine, but today I got lots of
these error during rendering of the composed model. I recently upgraded to
2014-12-04 version on Windows.

The error is:

CGAL error in CGAL_Nef_polyhedron3(): CGAL ERROR: assertion violation!
Expr: e->incident_sface() != SFace_const_handle()
File:
/data/OpenSCAD/libraries-mingw64-master/mxe-w64/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static/include/CGAL/Nef_S2/SM_const_decorator.h
Line: 328

When the rendering finishes none of the aluminum extrusions are included in
the model.

The projectfiles are here:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6293510/ForumThreads/forumOpenSCAD/cnc.zip

Can someone else try to render the same files? Startingpoint is cnc.scad.

Aha, good, then the idea wasn't as farfetched as I was afraid of. 

Hope someone implements it :)

Confirmed, 2014.03 renders the profile, 2014.12.04 does not. 
W7/64 64bit versions of OpenSCAD.

l'll have a poke around, but I'm assuming a OpenSCAD bug, not code issues.

Cut down version. 
With both 2020Profiles, it gets the F6 error, comment one out and it
doesn't.

use <TSlot_Fractional.scad>;
echo(version());
2020Profile(20);
//2020Profile(20);


BTW there is something dodgy with the corner brackets.

When I 'disabled' the fillet(), i.e.

module fillet(rad){
/*
	translate([-rad,-rad,0])
	difference(){
		translate([0,0,0]) square([rad+0.01,rad+0.01]);
		circle(r=rad,center=true,$fn=32);
	}
*/
}

The problem went away.

Thanks for verifying the problem MichaelAtOz.

Yes, I noticed the problem with the corner brackets as well. They don't
preview so good. You can see right through some of the material.

When you see that sort of effect, it's telling you that something is wrong,
such things are likely to produce bad STLs. You probably need to find and
fix the cause to get clean results.

It often comes down to co-incident faces.

In this case, I've cut it down to the following, and the fillet is probably
the issue. Still drilling down...

Subject: [OpenSCAD] G-code standard - Integers/rounding
Message-ID: <1418092226218-10442.post@n5.nabble.com>

I've been reading the The NIST RS274NGC Interpreter - Version 3  Manual
<http://technisoftdirect.com/catalog/download/RS274NGC_3.pdf>  . Yes I have
no life.

That is basically the G-code standard.

It says: "A decimal number which is supposed be close to an integer is
considered close enough if it is within 0.0001 of an integer."

Maybe that is enough of an excuse to round those 1e-13 numbers I see from
time to time.

In TSlot_Fractional.scad

change this line in module filter()
		translate([0,0,0]) square([rad,rad]); // remove the 0.01's

change this line (the last) in module tSlot()

	scale([1,-1,1]) translate([-0.087*25.4+0.01,-.255*25.4/2,0])
rotate([0,0,90]) fillet(minkR_TS/2);
	// add the -0.01

That fixes this specific problem, I don't know whether it will introduce
other problems.

But there is still a bug in OpenSCAD not handling it properly.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Non-manifold when union() or hull() a torus created with
 rotate_extrude()
Message-ID: <1418124208582-10448.post@n5.nabble.com>

I was investigating ways of filleting cylinders to make "cup" shapes and
thought I would be clever by hulling a torus with a regular cylinder, but I
consistently get a "non manifold" error when slicing the output.

Here is my code:

fillet_radius = 5;
inner_r = 30;
outer_r = inner_r+5;
cup_height = 70;

difference()
{
	// outer cup
	cylinder(h=cup_height, r=outer_r);

	// inner cavity
	translate([0, 0, fillet_radius])
		Cup(cup_height, inner_r, fillet_radius);
}

module Cup(height, radius, fillet_radius)
{
	translate([0, 0, fillet_radius])
		hull()
		{
			Ring_torus(R = radius-fillet_radius, r = fillet_radius);
			cylinder(h = height-fillet_radius, r = radius);
		}
}

module Ring_torus(R, r)
{
	rotate_extrude()
		translate([R, 0, 0])
			circle(r);
}

I have tried unioning the various parts before hulling, and also replacing
the hull with unions of cylinders (one large one, one small one, and a ring
torus to bridge the two) but the error persists. 

I've tried adding fudge factors in case there's a problem at the toroidal
'equator' but it doesn't help.

Interestingly, the problem doesn't occur if I don't union or hull the torus
with a cylinder. Is there a winding issue with objects created with
rotate_extrude() that only manifests when unioned with another object?

You may want to look into the joiner problem.
I'll have a look if I get around to it.

Message-ID: <1418146775995-10451.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi, 
have a piece of code that is crashing my Windows machine (not just the
OpenSCAD application, but the entire machine), and during troubleshooting I
noticed that the fileformat seems to have changed between the previous
version (2014-11-09) and the one I'm running now (2014-12-04).

When opening the .scad file in Notepad++ all the lines have an empty line
between them. So a four line long script ends up as eight lines. The lines
seems to have both a CR and a CRLF, which ends up as double the amount of
lines.

All the .scad files I created in the previous version only use CRLF as EOL
characters.

Hi, the following part is a corner bracket I've made which looks really weird

allright.

I can't see any problems with the latest dev-snapshot on Linux. The exported

Message-ID: <1418157114856-10455.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi, 
after upgrading from 2014-11-09 to 2014-12-04 OpenSCAD has begun to crash my
machine. Everything locks up and I need to do a hard power off to restart
it. I can't see any pattern when it happens. Perhaps when saving file, og
when previewing. (I rarely render, so its not that).

When the maching starts up again I've experienced a few times that the .scad
file has been corrupted. It only contains one line, and that line is just a
lot of NUL values. See screenshot.

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n10455/nullnullnull.png> 

I saw someone else mentioning OpenSCAD freezeing their machine as well, but
can't find that thread.

Are you saying
1. a new file created in 2014.12.04, saved, opened in Notepad++, has the
extra blank lines?
2. a file created with 2014.11.09, saved, opened in Notepad++ have extra
blank lines?

I use NP++, 1. does not have any extra blank lines, and View/Show-Symbal/All
just shows CRLF at EOL.

Scenario 1 gives blank lines.

I'm on version 2014-12-04. If I create a new file in OpenSCAD, and open it
using Notepad++ it looks like this:

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n10459/crcrlf.png> 

If I open up a file I created using the older version it looks good in
Notepad++.

The other report suggested the auto-reload feature was loading the file
before NP++ (IIRC anyway an external editor) had finished saving it.

Are you using Auto-reload?

The entire computer locks up, as in you can't even move the mouse?

Unless you are using Windows 98 :) a lock up of the entire computer is
usually a driver problem. In this case, it "must" be the graphics driver, as
OpenSCAD is a graphics program.

Yes, the entire machine freezes. Its as close to a bluescreen you can come
without it actually flipping over to the bluescreen.

Yes, I totally agree that the only thing that can cause this is a driver -
but I'm already using the newest version of the AMD driver. My money is
rather on OpenSCAD telling the videodriver to do something which is just way
off, and this causes the crash.

I'm running on a Samsung laptop which has two videocards. Both an Intel HD
Graphics 4000 and a AMD Radeon R9 M270X. When I use "TechPowerUp GPU-Z
0.8.0" to look at the processorpower of the two it seems like the AMDs GPU
is working really hard when OpenSCAD is open. My feeling is that OpenSCAD
uses the graphicscard in a inefficient way.

I'm still on the 11.05 snapshot of OpenSCAD on OSX - I'll update it later
and try again. I haven't tried running it through netfabb so I'll do that
too.
It sounds like Slic3r might be my problem - I tend to use whichever version
that is bundled with Repetier Host, and I have been a little lax in updating
this across all of my machines lately (I use a combination of OSX and
Windows).

Post Windows 98 it doesn't work like that. Windows actually grew up and
started to become an operating system. If it locks your box even by
telling it to do silly things then its a graphics driver/hardware bug
(and if its a hardware bug its a driver bug that it doesn't work around
the hardware bug ;-))

For F5 renders of certain curved surfaces I see similar problems in Linux
with a really old radeon card but not with Intel graphics. I'm pretty
sure its a driver bug in both cases therefore.

The F5 render does, but inefficient and crashing are quite different
things.

As someone who at one point upgraded my gaming PC roughly every year, I have
used both ATI/AMD and nVIDIA cards extensively and I usually push them to
their limits - sometimes beyond their limits, to my regret (and expense!).

/My purely subjective opinion/ is that nVIDIA is marginally more reliable
from a driver point of view than ATI (there was a glimmer of hope when AMD
took over but that hasn't really materialised) but I'm not convinced that
you'd ever see this if you're just using OpenSCAD.

I am currently looking at building a new games PC right now and the
bang-per-buck of the current flagship AMD cards is difficult to ignore, but
the issues I hear that are plaguing some owners are the same that have
always plagued me with ATI/AMD cards, which puts me off a little bit. Whilst
a pair of flagship nVIDIA cards is a stupidly expensive option, the
potential for reduced downtime almost justifies the cost. Almost.

In any case, my recommendation is to always use the official manufacturer's
drivers rather than any 'branded' versions that come with the cards
themselves, as they tend to be more stable and contain less bloatware.
They're also usually more recent as it takes time for the OEMs to re-badge
and apply branding.

Some card manufacturers offer lifetime/extended warranties, which may sway
your decision.

OpenSCAD is closely (but not exclusively) coupled to the needs of the 3D
printing user.  As such, color in the model is irrelevant.  The most common
3D output format, STL, doesn't have a standard representation for color at
all.

The issue of color in 3D printing comes down to what color filament
(assuming an FDM printer) is loaded.  So the same model could be printed in
any color of filament.

The issues is more complicated when printing with multiple extruders that
would then allow for multiple colors.  The bottom line here is that you
essentially create two models that are printed concurrently.  The colors for
the models are determined by the colors of filament loaded in the extruders.  

I have a  longish article with a lot more info about dual extruder printing
<http://www.printrbottalk.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=4472>   at
Printrbottalk.com that shows specific examples of how all this works.

Bottom line is that even if OpenSCAD did include color info, it wouldn't
help or matter with multi-color printing.

Ah, well, I don't have a gpu card at all right now. Just the Intel 
graphics that came with the chipset, a core 2 duo E8500 if memory 
serves. This system is not really deserving of spending much on 
upgrades, so I'm looking to see what I should be looking for in the near 
future.

And I have a 2.53Ghz dual core CPU and NVIDIA ION graphics.
The F5 preview is slow for complex models, getting to unusable on highly
complex ones. (I have yet to test 2014.12.09 changes)

I have a newer system I'm looking to migrate to, 16GB, faster Quad core,
currently with Intel integrated graphics, and an empty slot for a graphics
card.

Unless OpenSCAD implements CUDA, OpenCL, or another GPU-accelerated
compute tech, you won't see any difference between ATI and nVidia as
far as OpenSCAD rendering or display performance is concerned.
nVidia's linux drivers are, apparently, far better under linux. ATI's
drivers have always been pretty shitty even under Windows, speaking as
someone who has bought exclusively ATI cards for his gaming computer
for the last decade.

I'd see if you're happy with the performance of the embedded intel
graphics, but get a motherboard with a PCIex16 slot so you have the
option of putting in a separate video card later if you want.

I noticed that CGAL and OpenCSG both have a dependency on libGL, so they do use
OpenGL for something or other.

OpenSCAD itself appears to use QtOpenGL, presumably for rendering the viewport.

For running both OpenSCAD and FreeCAD you shouldn't really need to get a
high-end videocard.

On my stationary I've got a quad-processor, 16GB ram and a ATI HD 6570
videocard. I could probably run Battlefield without problems, but a fairly
simple model in OpenSCAD is pretty choppy when rotating.

Even on my laptop I can run complex simulations in Chrome and WebGL (f.ex
http://aleksandarrodic.com/p/jellyfish/) that are just silky smooth, while
rotating a cube in OpenSCAD is a choppy experience. Yes, sure, it's probably
a different technology, but the point is that the weakest link here isn't
the graphics card or the drivers, but OpenSCAD itself. Hopefully this will
become better if OpenSCAD switches over to newer OpenGL technology. I think
I saw it mentioned somewhere that someone was working on that?

MichaelAtOz:
Simply upgrading to the integrated graphics in the latest intel processors 
(haswell i3/5/7 4xxx) should give you a very significant increase in
graphics performance.

wmartin will very likely see the same performance increase.

When it comes to graphics cards it appears to me like more expensive is
better. You get what you pay for. Note that the cheaper ones give less
performance than the integrated graphics in haswell processors.

There were a bunch of OpenSCAD issues with Intel graphics some time ago, are
they still problematic?

Yes, currently there's pretty much nothing to gain in terms of performance
for OpenSCAD from a high-end graphics card. The only issue is bad OpenGL
drivers that produce wrong renders or even crashes.
On Linux both the nouveau and the proprietary nvidia driver seem to work
fine.

Mentioned yes:
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/wiki/Project%3A-Improve-OpenGL-rendering

As far as I know, there is nobody actively working on that yet. I do have
some prototyping stuff in a separate application, but nothing specific for
OpenSCAD yet.

ciao,
  Torsten.

Sorry but this is no longer really true.

How you would extend it into CSG model is another question, most real
world printers texture the outside and texture mapping hardly fits the
CSG model. That's a problem because while you can flip an OpenSCAD model
into say Blender and texture it you can't then easily recompile the model
as you have to reapply all the texture work.

And yes this is relevant to home not just fancy printers, because while
they generally can't print onto the surface for many applications you can
take the texture set, flatten it and vinyl cut or decal print all the
needed sections and then add them to the object.

Perhaps it would be a good idea to reach out to the OpenGL community? Maybe
someone there thinks this would be a fun project to help with?

The forum at OpenGL (https://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/) seems to be
lively. I'm sure someone there could be motivated by a well-written
forumpost where we explain what kind of challenges OpenSCAD has currently
with OpenGL.

I'm very interested in, but afraid I do not follow, your point.  Are you
saying that it is no longer true that OpenSCAD is closely coupled to 3D
printing?  Or are you saying that the irrelevancy of color in the model to
3D printing is no longer true?

Since the STL format doesn't natively support color and multicolor printing
is based on independently colorless models (much like all the images in a
color separation for printing are actually grayscale,) I am going to guess
that your point is about the relationship of OpenSCAD to 3D printing.

I absolutely agree that OpenSCAD has become useful for a wide range of 3D
modelling tasks.  But its genesis and the vast majority of its use is in the
3D printing worl, so it clearly has a special relationship to 3D printing. 
As the engine for the Thingivese Customizer, it's become central to an
important part of the 3D printing world.

I apologize, I was less able to follow your thread in this part of your
response.  Are you referring to texture mapping in the way that Blender can
apply a flat image to the shell of a model?   This is not a common feature
in commercial or personal 3D printers at this time.  Even Shapeways only
offers this with one material, Sandstone (no plastics or metals,) and they
require an independent texture map to be sent with the 3D model.

I have a vinyl cutter and have applied appliques to printed models as you
suggest.  But the modelling for the vinyl cutter is 2D and requires a
different set of disciplines to make it fit a 3D shape than is used for 3D
modelling alone.  I've spent many hours doing the unfolding tasks with Sheet
Metal CAD programs after the 3D model is done so that the 2D model is
usable.  'Unfolding' is usually a different module in 3D modelling programs
than the main modelling section.

As noted, I apologize if I have misunderstood your point.

The irrelevancy of the colour model hasn't been true for a couple of
years at least. Not just for Shapeways sandstone stuff - there are also 3D
printers using paper layer that do full colour.

STL is just an export format, it's a detail. You can change the format,
extend to one of the STL + colour formats etc.

More importantly it can unwrap a 3D object into a set of flat foldable
shapes which can be textured and rewrapped.

It's a trivial piece of post-processing after you've printed it. 3D
printing is just a tool as part of an integrated production system. You
can home 3D print an object, mill it, cast copies and vinyl it these days.

I don't intend to be a slave to the tools. I work with a mix of etched
brass, 3D printed OpenSCAD output and vinyl. I don't expect to spend
hours doing unfolding tasks with a CAD program. The reason the tools
exist is so I don't have to spend hours doing pointless automatable jobs.

Many of my textures are machine composited and drawn from the same
rulesets as the 3D and brass. When you have to do a bit of hand tweaking
however it then becomes a pain because you can't preserve things like the
texture bindings.

Yes, STL does not support any way of giving more than just the triangle
information. But almost the whole (free software) 3D printing tool-chain
supports other formats that are able to handle additional information like
multiple volumes, colors, and so on, the newest being AMF (http://stl2.org).

What's still missing is wide support to actually use those features (e.g.
slicers have some support, OpenSCAD currently none at all), so there is
quite a way to go for full color / multi material support...

ciao,

As linked in my initial response (
http://www.printrbottalk.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=4472
<http://www.printrbottalk.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=4472>  ) , I've
spent a lot of time documenting the current process for multi-extruder
(which is the primary means of multi-color) FDM 3D printing.  I am 100% in
agreement that the toolchain, most importantly post OpenSCAD or other
modeller, is painfully missing the requisite support for multiple colors.

I also am 100% in agreement with the sentiment:

> I don't intend to be a slave to the tools.

but as a guy who makes his living writing software I am sadly aware of the
delta between "I don't like the way this works!" and "I've got a wonderful
new toolchain that works great!"  Luckily OpenSCAD has a great active
community and can continue to be at the forefront of new development like
color support.  But even if it supported it 100%, there is a lot of
additional work downstream before home users will be able to take advantage
of it.

I don't mean to be dismissive of alternate approaches such as 2D appliques
or high-end 3D printing service shops.  The OP asked about how they could
print multi-color and I assumed they were talking about home FDM printing. 
The link I posted was an attempt to specifically answer this question with
images and examples.  I apologize if I didn't address other approaches
outside that mainline, they may soon become more common and hence deserve
attention.

Entirely agreed - I just wanted to expand beyond FDM, because in a lot of
markets (eg model making) we've been using 3D print + vinyls/decals for
some years.

Absolutely.

Sorry wasn't intended to be a criticism but to expand the discussion more
widely beyond the world of FDM.

ok, this is exciting :)
I?m also talking to the developers of the 5-color FFF printer from http://www.ordsolutions.com (we're in the same city). I?m sure you can imagine what sort of challenges they have in terms of slicing and firmware.

If we limit our discussion to FFF-style printer for now, the workflow is essentially to design one (or more) _non-intersecting_ solid volumes per material.
Right now, OpenSCAD doesn?t offer a good way of managing this non-intersecting requirement, but we could fix that. I.e. make it easier to create non-intersecting volumes where each volume is tagged with material info. 
Once that is solved, having a convenient ?one-click? export into a file (or set of files) which slicers could read directly would make sense.

I tried to create a multi-material test design, but it turned out to be a bit painful: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:178713

I started scribbling some stuff down here: https://github.com/openscad/openscad/wiki/Multi-material-support
If you have any insight, stuff to add, or want to discuss this, I?d love to touch base.
#openscad on freenode is a good place for more real-time communication.

Message-ID: <1418332140496-10500.post@n5.nabble.com>

IMHO, the most appealing path for basic/home FFF users would be an AMF export
capability.  Even if the AMF format support was initially only STL under the
covers (leveraging AMF's backward compatibility for STL triangles,) and only
added multi-materials.

Slic3r will work with AMF, in fact it's the only way it will do
multi-material.  It will convert multiple STLs into an AMF, but there are
some interesting considerations in the way it does so.  The order in which
the STLs are added to the AMF determines the association of the model to
extruder.  There isn't any way (at this time/version) to re-assign which
extruder goes with which material/model.

>From the  Slic3r manual
<http://manual.slic3r.org/expert-mode/multiple-extruders>  :
"If a multi-material AMF file already exists, because the CAD program can
export such a format, then this can be loaded into Slic3r in the usual way.
The mapping between object materials and extruders is sequential, i.e. the
first material is assigned to the first extruder, etc."

This implies an awareness in the modelling software (or the user of such,)
which extruder is going to be associated with which material/section/model. 
This can be tricky.  My printer has a front and back arrangement with the
front 1.75mm bowden extruder and a rear 3mm direct extruder.  I have to do a
surprising amount of planning with multi-material prints to get the results
I desire.  Other printers have different configurations, leading to
different considerations.

So a story/requirement for the modelling software would be to allow the user
to define which model/material/section is 'first', 'second', etc.   (which
could potentially limit the usability of that model by different FFF users,
since the order may need to be different for different printers.)

Fun, tricky stuff!

Probably overkill, but obsproject (free) and fraps (free but feature limited)
will do motion screen capture on Windows. It's what people tend to use when
recording themselves playing games on YouTube.

I tend to favour my MBP when doing screencaps of OpenSCAD because QuickTime
Player does it, which is bundled with the OS.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Multmatrix (and its mysterious 4th row) for idiots
Message-ID: <1418416512105-10506.post@n5.nabble.com>

I have struggled for a long time with the multmatrix() function.  Especially
with the apparently vestigial fourth row!  What do the various value
mean????

Starting with  a clue from clothbot in another thread
<http://forum.openscad.org/Arbitrary-Transformation-tp3293p3300.html>   to
go read up on forward kinematics, I began researching (sadly well above my
maths level,) the following is what I've found.  I post simply to save time
for other poor confused souls like myself.   Many readers will cringe at my
innumeracy and I can only express gratitude to any poster who is willing to
point out flaws, misunderstandings or hilarity in my description.

The multmatrix function uses  Denavit and Hartenberg (D-H) parameters
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denavit%E2%80%93Hartenberg_parameters>  . 
This is a 4x4 transformation matrix convention initially created for use in
working with  kinematic chains
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematic_chain>   and robot manipulators.  It
has since found use in a variety of 3D graphics implementations.  

Here is the OpenSCAD example of a multimatrix function to do the equivalent
of translate([10,20,30]):
multmatrix(m = [ [1, 0, 0, 10],
                         [0, 1, 0, 20],
                         [0, 0, 1, 30],
                         [0, 0, 0,  1]
                       ]) 

The D-H matrix can be thought of as a 3x3 matrix (top right 3 rows and
columns) that define linear transformations such as scaling, shearing,
reflection and rotation combined with a 1x3 array (the first 3 rows of the
rightmost column,) that define translations in the x, y and z axes.

This is a breakdown of what you can do with the independent elements in the
matrix (for the first three rows):
[Scale X],[Scale X sheared along Y],[Scale X sheared along Z], [Translate X]
[Scale Y sheared along X],[Scale Y],[Scale Y sheared along Z], [Translate Y]
[Scale Z sheared along X],[Scale Z sheared along Y],[Scale Z], [Translate Z]

Combinations of changes to various elements result in an astonishing variety
of transformations. Use of trigonometric functions such as cosines and sines
result in  rotational effects
<https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Transformations#multmatrix> 
.  

But what about that fourth row?  Nearly every place I found a D-H (or
related) matrix on the web had the same values: 0,0,0,1.  I occasionally
encountered oblique references to uses such as perspective transformation 
(e.g.,the  OpenGL Frustum
<http://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_projectionmatrix.html>   command,) but
nothing that I tried in the fourth row of the multmatrix function in
OpenSCAD appeared to do anything.

More research lead me to  DUAL LIGHT BARRIER METHOD FOR SIX DEGREES OF
FREEDOM TOOL CENTER POINT CALIBRATION OF AN INDUSTRIAL ROBOT
<http://www.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/99163/Paananen_Thesis_FINAL.pdf?sequence=2> 
, Veli-Joel Paananen's Master's thesis at the Lappeenranta University of
Technology's Department of Mechanical Engineering.  (light reading.)

Veli-Joel Paananen had this to say on page 20 while discussing the 
homogeneous transformation matrix
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_matrix>  :
*Adding a fourth row of nulls and one to the general transformation does not
affect the result.

The added row is not just to create a quadratic matrix: in 3D-graphics or
computer vision
systems, the 1x3 vector below rotation matrix is used to produce perspective
transformations between frames and the scalar below position vector to
define scaling.
/However, these are neglected in basic manipulator geometry and kinematics/*
(italics are mine)

So, for the purposes of multmatrix, the fourth row is pretty much just there
to make a consistent 4x4 matrix.  

Those of you with sufficient maths will have likely considered all this
obvious  but I apparently slept through this stuff.

Others like me who are bootstrapping themselves into this topic may do well
to follow the advice of 
mabulous, whose excellent page on 
<http://mabulous.com/understanding-and-interpreting-the-homogeneous-transformation-matrix-in-3d-space>
*Understanding and interpreting the homogeneous transformation matrix in 3D
space*  suggests that those who want to learn more about   homogeneous
coordinate vectors <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates>  
and  affine transformations
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation>   should learn enough
to:
1. know what vectors and matrices are
2. understand matrix*matrix and matrix*vector multiplications by performing
a few of them on paper
3. understand what a homogeneous coordinate vector is

Cheers!

Denavit-Hartenberg parameters are not really related to any of this.

There is no such thing as a Denavit-Hartenberg matrix --- it is general called 
an affine transform matrix, or perhaps a homogeneous transformation matrix.

Denavit-Hartenberg parameters are used in kinematics to compactly describe the 
orientation of one link in a kinematic chain.  There is a simple mapping from 
D-H parameters to an affine transformation matrix, but not every affine 
transformation matrix can be represented by a set of D-H parameters.

This is because D-H parameters are used to encode transformations that can 
actually be physically built.  (We can build a joint that rotates, but not one 
that reflects or shears --- but reflection and shear are easily represented 
with an affine transformation matrix).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

> But what about that fourth row?

The fourth row is a computational necessity, nothing more.  Matrix 
transformations can only encode origin-preserving transformations  
(transformations that map (0,0,0) to (0,0,0)).

Translation is not origin preserving (for example, translation by (1,0,0) maps 
(0,0,0) to (1,0,0)).  However, we really want a compact notation where we can 
write

    y = M * x

and include translation.

The (somewhat inelegant) solution is to bump the problem up from 3 dimensions 
to 4 dimensions.

If we had a point (x,y,z) in three dimensions, we replace it with the 4-
dimensional point (x,y,z,1).

We then write our transformation like this:

    y = [      |  ]   [x]
        [  L   | t] * [y]
        [      |  ]   [z]
        [0 0 0 | 1]   [1]

Where L is 3-dimensional linear part (a 3x3 matrix that encodes rotation, 
shear, scaling, reflection, etc.), and t is the 3-dimensional translation 
part.

This is origin-preserving ((0,0,0,0) maps to itself), but it encodes the 3-
dimensional calculation:

   y = Lx + t

which is what we wanted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

> nothing that I tried in the fourth row of the multmatrix function

Most systems which are not interested in perspective calculations won't bother 
to store the fourth row, since they "know" it will be [ 0 0 0 1 ].

I can't speak for OpenSCAD specifically, but many systems that have a 
multmatrix()-like primitive will actually directly extract L and t, and do the 
3-dimensional calculation above, since it's less work than a full 4x4 
multiplication.

Thanks everyone.

For posterity:

I tried VLC, but it didn't record the cursor. It is not obvious how to do
it, but a quick search get instructions.

I tried obsproject, couldn't initially get it to work. You need to right
click in Sources.

Tried Hypercam 2 (the free one) and it did a nice job, including graphically
showing clicks. 
Movie will Premier shortly.

Message-ID: <1418439451600-10510.post@n5.nabble.com>

See my issues with designs with lots of elements.

The multiple repaint shows up here, sometimes it flashes white/showing/white
a number of times.
Resizing the window with constant repaints is hopelessly slow.
Changing the view is really slow, often causing 'Not Responding'

Changing it to larger=false (100x100) is just usable.

Removing difference or using Thrown together works normally.

This is not version dependent, same in 2014.03, later versions are
marginally better.

Code
cut_-_memory_use.scad
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n10510/cut_-_memory_use.scad>  
Video (boring - sorry for all the waiting, but the flashing takes time and
is inconsistent)
v4_resampled_2.mp4 (8MB, 7m37s)
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n10510/v4_resampled_2.mp4>  

I'm happy to raise an issue of someone can supply words to describe that
behaviour more concisely.

This is the CPU/GPU.

I recall issues with Inter HD graphics, are they resolved? Otherwise I'd
probably add a Geoforce card.

Hi Michael, I can confirm the same bad performance here. Tried on both
2014-11-09 and 2014-12-04 versions on two Win64 machines.

Although it is a bit sluggish, I don't have any "real" problems here.
Upgrading to the integrated graphics in your i7 3xxx processor will
definetely solve this problem for you.

I've been noticing that Nvidia has co-processor "CUDA" cards that do not 
include video out, for a good bit less money
than the graphics cards. If one were to build openSCAD from source & 
link with the Nvidia math library & driver code,
any thoughts on what order of speed-up might be possible? Depends on the 
nature of the math being done, no doubt,
but lots of matrix multiplies lie underneath the openSCAD primitives.

Absolutely zero unless you reprogram those parts of OpenSCAD from scratch.

Message-ID: <1418497015169-10516.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi, I want to try to compile OpenSCAD for Windows, and came across two pages
in the Documentation section on the openscad.org site related to Windows.
Seems like it's been a while since they were updated, though.

This page
(https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Building_on_Windows)
mentions that you need Visual Studio 2008, and references an old QT.

Has anyone tried using Visual Studio 2013? Are any of the current developers
using Windows?

No, unfortunately at this point there's no active developer working on Windows.
I'm doing the Windows builds but that's cross-compiling using MXE on Linux, so
any help would be awesome. Especially tracking down issues that only happen on
Windows is quite hard right now.
Currently the biggest help is MichaelAtOz putting lots of time into testing on
Windows, that's extremely helpful as otherwise Windows specific problems could
go unnoticed for quite some time.

Getting a native build on Windows is probably a bit of a challenge first as
nobody got as far as a fully working version. I think there are some threads
on both Github and the forum, the first I found is:

https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/431

I guess the first step would be to get the libraries compiled (maybe with some
replacements as mentioned in the issue discussion above).

The plan is to maybe make text() optional, that would mean the first try could
skip fontconfig, freetype and harfbuzz.

ciao,
   Torsten.

Ah, that's too bad.

I'm a descent C# programmer, but have very little experience with C++ and
the Qt/Ming/etc toolchain. Perhaps if someone else was also interrested in
getting OpenSCAD compiled on Windows we could attempt it together. On my own
I'm afraid I'm just not capable.

I can help with my Windows 7 VM. OpenGL is not working there, but getting
the build environment up and running should be possible. I'm just not
interested in doing that for myself as I'm not planning to do development
on Windows in my spare time.
If someone else wants to join the effort, that would be great.

I guess there's two options to start. Either using MinGW / MSYS or using
the community edition of Visual Studio. At least from license point of
view that seems usable (but I might be wrong, I'm still confused after
reading though their mumbo-jumbo announcement).

In my opinion the first try could be VS2013 as that is probably more
attractive than a command line only MinGW build.

Right now, I don't know what the best option is, but we did talk about
that in the past, and the most promising idea was to provide a dev-package
as download with the pre-compiled dependencies.

So we could start with getting CGAL and it's dependencies (boost, gmp,
mpfr, ...?) compiled and maybe a simple test program running.
The github issue mentions that replacing gmp with mpir might help.

ciao,
   Torsten.

I'd be interested in seeing what I can do to help.  I have an MSDN license
and have Visual Studio 2008 through 2013 already installed (VS2013 is a
weirdly different beast in a lot of ways.)  

I'll start seeing if I can get the environment set up.  I'm primarily using
the SSIS and CLR db environments doing C# and VB at the moment, but there
shouldn't be any reason why I can't configure this (he says after spending
almost two weeks getting the new WCF-based Database Tools to add a stinking
web service reference in VS 2013...)

I'll start and report back.

It seems to me that the Qt Visual Studio Addin is only available for a paid
version of Qt...? Then I began to think about perhaps just use the QT
Creator IDE that ships with Qt? Is there any reason why that shouldn't work
with OpenSCAD?

For comparison. Inter HD 4000 is pretty low on the list.

I think that should work too. What compiler is that using? I'm actually
using NetBeans and just run the GUI Designer when I need to edit the *.ui
files.

The GUI Designer should be included in the Qt download and that's all what's
needed. Maybe the add-in saves a click here and there when working on the GUI,
but OpenSCAD does not have too much GUI anyway ;).

Hmm, that might make things easier as that's essentially the same
we use with MXE.
I wonder if we can just build the libs with MXE on Linux and drop
them into Qt Creator on Windows?

I'm an experienced C++ programmer in the Windows environment, but my time is 
wretchedly constricted at the moment. Nonetheless, if you could use some 
guidance I'd be willing to pitch in.

I think it would be really valuable for the OpenSCAD project if we managed to
come up with a step-by-step guide on how to do development and testing on
Windows machines.

I'm sure there are very skilled programmers out there which would contribute
to the OpenSCAD source if it was easy to get started.

The Wiki could use a new and updated page on how to set up the development
environment in Windows. I don't think it really matters if it uses Qt
Creator or Visual Studio, as long as it it a working guide as to how to get
started.

I can start work on such a page, and can be a guinnea pig when it comes to
following the instructions, but when it comes to the nitty gritty details on
figuring out which parameters to use, which header files to copy where etc,
I'm not capable of figuring that out myself.

But if we can cooperate on what do download, which libraries are needed, how
to compile them and how to configure Qt Creator, then I'm in.

The goal for me would be to end up with a functional wiki-page, which then
can be used to attract new experienced developers on the Windows platform -
thus making my new favorite CAD software better :)

I've got a fresh Win8.1 machine that I'm setting up per the new model. 

First issue that Ive noticed in installing Qt is that there are a LOT of
choices about what gets installed, both version and component.  I'm starting
with the most recent version of Qt, 5.4 and probably a big overkill on
additional components.  Download is taking 8+ hours.  

We'll want to figure out what the minimal install is at some point, and I
have no doubt that either Qt or some number of its associated tools or
addons (e.g. MinGW) will have to be downgraded.

I'm keeping notes, hopefully the right ones!

Maybe MSYS2 is the easiest way to get everything running. This includes
qtcreator and most of the libraries. Actually only OpenCSG and QScintilla
are missing.

=> https://msys2.github.io/

Using the MXE builds with the Qt download does not work as they seem to
use different configuration regarding C++ exceptions so the libraries built
with MXE are not compatible with the MinGW shipped with Qt Creator.

ciao,
   Torsten.

Did you manage to load the .pro file with QtCreator on Windows?
When I tried this a while ago QtCreator couldn't load the file.

Also I feel like I must warn you. It will be a lot easier to setup a
secondary/virtual linux pc. Getting all these dependencies configured and
compiled on Windows... I tried but ... lost patience

Yes, there's a small change needed in version.pri:

It jumps into the Unix branch and executes date with the Unix parameters
causing it to wait for user input.

Changing:
   win32-msvc*:!mingw-cross-env

To:
   win*:!mingw-cross-env {

prevents that.

Otherwise I've just hacked the include/lib path into openscad.pro to see
if it's compiling.
That works so far that the welcome screen comes up, but when trying to
open the main window it terminates with a Qt error:

QWidget: Must construct a QApplication before a QWidget

ciao,
   Torsten.

Torsten, I made that first change, and now it properly lists files in the Qt
Creator project tree. But what is that other change you refer to as "I've

In Release mode it works now. I guess we do something wrong which does not
trigger the qFatal() on other platforms. So that's maybe a real issue and
not a problem with the native Windows build environment.

"I have no doubt that either Qt or some number of its associated tools or addons 
(e.g. MinGW) will have to be downgraded. "

On this point, everything we include needs to be tagged with a version and/or 
build number. The world of Java is really good about this with Maven and C# has 
NuGet, but I don't know if there's an equivalent for C++.

There's one "-I" too many, just before the harfbuzz one. Not sure where
that's coming from.
I'll try to reproduce. Just need to set up a VM.

There is a small delay when posting before it gets sent to the list. Looks

Anyone have a perspective on GPU Memory consumption of OpenSCAD, any
advantage of 4BG over 2GB?

Ha!  I didn't take your */warning /*near seriously enough!  There are
definitely ominous omens surrounding this effort.  While installing msys2 on
my 'fresh' laptop it seemed to oddly hang during the download.  Then,
moments later, while printing an ornament for my festivus pole, I managed to
knock a can of hairspray off the shelf crashing it into the keyboard of the
laptop.  A really good solid kinetic transfer of energy. 

The laptop worked for a little while, it hung, it worked, it hung hard, it
crashed.  It boots to recovery mode, recovery mode crashes.  It reboots and
boot manager denies the existence of any bootable media.  (and joy of joys,
it's a UEFI box, so futzing with the boot is a real can of fun  ).

Oh well, I wanted an SSD for the box in any case and now I'll get an early
christmas present.  If I'd known that setting up the environment for
building OpenSCAD in Windows involved starting from a virgin hard drive on
up, I might have hesitated...

But the motto that's gotten me through 20 years of software & hardware
development has always been "How hard can it be?"  So on to another learning
experience! 

Cheers,

How about something simple like:

MyVar =parameter(index,list_of_values);

Where the simplest in-program interpretation is:

function parameter(index,list_of_values)=list_of_values[index];

...but it may encapsulate alternate functionality based on arguments provided, such as range-checking, interpolation, etc.

It could/would also provide the breakout hooks to dynamic UI generation/configuration, most likely in the same panel as the animation/time-stepping interface.

I'm a bit confused now. First I thought this list is where the internal
discussions take place. Then I noticed most of the dev talk is happening on
git hub. Now back to the mailing list. Anyways

One thing to note about the Customizer like parameter definition is it would
be very easy to implement. I could hook this up to the existing OpenSCAD
code base in just a few hours coding and testing and - as you can see in my
code branch already - it would touch the existing code only in two points.
That means it would be a clearly defined code module with a very simple
interface and thus less likely to interfere with other parts of the code.
(Well actually I'm not 100% certain it won't interfere with other parts of
the code because there seems to be some feature which references the last
compiled document but without an in dept analysis of the code it is unclear
which feature it is. I suspect it's the 'automatic reload' feature but I
can't say for sure because the code for this feature seems to be all over
mainwin.cc )

Now lets look at the function style definition: xyz = select( name="your
parameter", default = 1.0, values = [ 10:2.0:30 ] );
I think this one would be more intuitive for the user. But it would be much
more difficult to parse. Regular expressions won't do it here. This needs to
be processed by the lexer. Now the question is when and from where to invoke
the lexer? From the Parametric UI module after each change of the source in
the editor? I think this would be preferred as it would result in a 'snappy'
ui but what to do with syntax errors then? This definition is already
somewhat prone to syntax errors like mismatching brackets, typos, etc.

Then there is the annotation style. It might have benefits to do it this
way. I'm not seeing them atm but I haven't read through all issues on github
yet. So I might be missing something here. What I do see is the same
problematic as for the function style definitions. If you plan on rewriting
most of the code anyway then this might be the way to go I don't know.
Otherwise personally I probably would go with the customizer comment syntax
since that could be considered the standard right now and it's not a big
deal to implement.

Nice :)

Could you elaborate a bit on what purposes you see for such an SVG file?
I can imagine it being interesting to extend the "export to PNG" function in
OpenSCAD to allow exporting to SVG. We have all the info available, so it
shouldn't be too hard. The challenge is to cover the most important
use-cases in terms of shading and projection.

Yes, internal details, very specific to an issue, are good on Github.
Things like discussions about GUI or language changes can reach a much
wider audience on the mailing list and provide more ideas. E.g. the pointer
Felipe posted does sound interesting.

True, but what's the point? It's a dead end, we can't extend it in any
way. Or if we extend it, it will be again incompatible with Customizer.
So the benefit is pretty limited to one specific solution.
I'm sure that with a little more effort we can get a solution that will
allow extension and integrates nicely with the parser. This opens the
path for a huge list of interesting things. Yes, all that might take a
while, like the text() feature is now at one year discussions and
refinements and it's still not 100% finished yet.

I don't see a big parsing problem here. The current parser could handle
the syntax already. Picking out the values would be possible and the
trigger could be the same as it is in your code.
I see the problem that the user visible part is limiting it to just the
variable assignment case and that it will pretend an interactive behavior
that is simply not there. The function is _not_ called when evaluating
the assignment, the function syntax is only used as container for meta
data.

Yes, it would need a small extension to the parser. But so did the
list-comprehensions, and those are an awesome new feature.

In my completely personal view it's not a standard but an ugly hack that
does serve a useful purpose and works reasonably well for that.
Defining that as official language would make me sad as I don't see any
way for it to evolve.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Smoothing with hull?
Message-ID: <1418679852858-10550.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi, I just wanted to try making a quick propeller in OpenSCAD, and thought I
had a brilliant idea, but it's not turning out exactly like I pictured it.

My plan was to do this:
//hull() {
cylinder(d=20, h=10, center=true);
for (x = [-100:2:100]) {
    translate([x, 0, 0]) rotate([x,0,0]) cylinder(10, center=true);
}
//}

to create this, and then do a hull() on it to smooth out the edges. 

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n10550/Propeller.png> 

But when I do a hull() on the entire thing it doesn't really look like a
propeller, but more like a treetrunk :/

Is there any way to make the hull "tighter", if you know what I mean?

No, hull() is currently always producing the convex hull, it can't create
any concave objects. But have a look at:

I'm looking to build a CNC Router.
While it is early days, SVG comes up frequently as the filetype to feed the
router.

I'd like to use OpenSCAD to design for the CNC, so SVG as an export format
may be good. 
(I say may, as I said, early days in my research - any pointers welcome)

Exporting 2D models as SVG is already implemented in the dev-snapshots.

That 3D model export as SVG does look nice, maybe a scalable display on a
web page could also use that.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] text() halign/valign and alignment with other geometry.
Message-ID: <1418707368314-10556.post@n5.nabble.com>

This is in relation to  text module issues issues #803
<https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/803>  , specifically re "u)
Discussion re valign/halign. I will post more on this shortly."

Discussing here rather than cluttering up Github.

My issue is about fitting text() generated geometry with other geometry.
With all other modules (baring use of random) it is possible to calculate
the edges of objects and position/align them appropriately.

With text however, the generated geometry is incalculable, different fonts
and glyphs have variable edges.

This is inconvenient, but it will also increase the co-incident faces issue
and non-manifold geometry. particularly in the future with Customizer and
the similar GUI concept being discussed ATM, where the text is unknown at
programming time.

Firstly size (y-axis) is approximate (and glyph dependent), width (x-axis)
is glyph dependent. (thankfully they don't have a variable z-axis...)

The wiki says "text will have approximately an ascent of the given value
(height above the baseline)".

I measured these (size=10) by sizing a cube next to them.

Font                            Size
arial                             9.983
rockwell                        9.41
times new roman            9.215
Century Schoolbook      10.05
Courier New                  7.9

halign/valign to the rescue? I hoped so, but "currently the center
calculation uses the glyph bounding box multiplied with the spacing factor,
so the additional space (in case of spacing > 1) is behind the character."


Which means halign="center" is not centered when spacing<>1, and
halign="right" is not aligned, but strangely "left" is OK. See images below,
the coloured blocks represent the additional (for spacing=1.5), or reduced
(for spacing=0.5) space, code is attached.

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n10556/ha_left.jpg> 
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n10556/ha_center.jpg> 
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n10556/ha_right.jpg> 

text_left.scad <http://forum.openscad.org/file/n10556/text_left.scad>  
text_center.scad <http://forum.openscad.org/file/n10556/text_center.scad>  
text_right.scad <http://forum.openscad.org/file/n10556/text_right.scad>  

I think the spacing for the first and last character should be adjusted as
appropriate taking into case both halign and direction (as behaviour is
illogical for direction="rtl" ATM). Alternatively if the bounding box for
the text is retrievable (the actual text - ie ignoring space at edges),
appropriate calculations and translations could be done.

My concern is if it is released now, it will be forever locked in by
backward compatibility. 

Perhaps release text() without halign/valign & direction (and possibly
spacing), allowing this to be sorted out for next release???

Then there is vertical, I'm less prepared for that, so I'll post separately.
But here's a teaser:

For me, the biggest issue is that "export to PNG" isn't high enough quality.
There's no anti-aliasing, and the image seems to be dependent on the
graphics card to render properly -- I get different images on my home and
work computer. If I want to simulate anti-aliasing, I can do the graphics
card-like thing and make the image 4x the original size, then resize back to
the original, but that get's very fiddly (especially when you can only
change the rendered image size by resizing the window).

It's also not particularly friendly for use with other vector graphics
images, or for other vector-ish manipulations. If I want the edges of each
surface to be black or grey, I can't do that (very easy to do in Inkscape
with SVG files). If I want to weave a 3D image around a cartoon, that's also
difficult to do accurately without an SVG rendering. Vector files are also
useful for embedding in PDF files for accurate display at both print and
screen resolutions (e.g. for images in a manual).

As a clarification, this isn't layer slicing -- that I can do somewhat
easily via other methods. This is rendering the 3D model as an SVG file.

Michael, I'm also on a quest to make a CNC machine, and want to use this as
the base design: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tkm5cUOVtSo

I'm both designing the machine in OpenSCAD, and later hoping to use OpenSCAD
for making all the parts I'm going to mill. However, I'm a bit discouraged
after some of the comments in this thread
(http://forum.openscad.org/Using-OpenSCAD-for-CNC-milled-aluminum-jobs-td9977.html)
where it is stated that OpenSCAD isn't suitable for making parts for CNC
milling.

Yes, I think it's using an offscreen OpenGL buffer and renders there
(in the commandline case). In GUI it's essentially just a screenshot.
Maybe it's possible to have a switch for antialiasing. For the GUI
the code is there but disabled with a comment that it's producing
render artefacts.

I think there's at least two ways how to add improved image export.

1) Adding something similar to your script, I guess that could use
the render color schemes to provide a basic level of customization.

2) Adding an export for existing raytracers like povray or yafaray.
That's discussed from time to time too as it would be a nice way to
generate high quality images. Unfortunately it might be limited to
single model color until OpenSCAD learns to handle color/materials
in the final rendering too. Maybe for some models the CSG could be
done in the raytracer.

Ahh, so much interesting stuff, so little time :-).

ciao,
  Torsten.

Same with most imports, except for DXF there's the dxf_dim() hack.

We can change that. Any idea how to handle it? Distribute the spacing
for each glyph at both sides and remove at the outside?

I think the alignment specific to text() should be based on the glyph
information and not geometrically. If we remove that, there's no way
at all to use the font specified metrics anymore.

For geometric alignment we could have an additional module that does
it. That would even allow to center other geometry, e.g. generated using
rand() or imported files.

That way we can have all cases covered and even make the (geometric)
alignment functionality more general and not just specific to text.

ciao,
  Torsten.

Ah, right. There's a command-line interface for exporting to images, with
custom width/height. Thanks for [implicitly] mentioning that. That helps a
lot.

Good question, I had to think about since yesterday. :)

Create each cylinder twice and hull each pair:

cylinder(d=20, h=10, center=true); 

for (x = [-100:2:100]) { 
    hull() {
        translate([x, 0, 0]) rotate([x,0,0]) cylinder(10, center=true,
$fn=4);
        translate([x+2, 0, 0]) rotate([x+2,0,0]) cylinder(10, center=true,
$fn=4); 
    }
} 

Best wishes,
Bananapeel :)

Good solution Bananapeel. That is what I pictured in my head as well. Had to
get out of bed yesterday to try my "brilliant" idea, which didn't turn out
so good as yours did.

I'd like to research the sweep(), loft() and skin() functions as well. Those
sounds more like the proper way to create a organic surface.

Thanks Koenig!

The result looks similar to Bananapeels, but this is very nice with the
parameterized setup. I see that you choose to start out with a 2D object,
which is extruded with a twist. Nice.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Problem Rendering Polyhedron with another object
Message-ID: <1418770741868-10568.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi,
I am creating a star shaped polyhedron (that is raised in the middle of the
star) that renders fine when its all alone. When I try to add another object
(like a cylinder with the object - creating a small ring at the tip of the
star), it will preview fine, but will not render both objects together. I
can comment out either one and the other renders fine. Here is the design,
any ideas? :

// Thickness of the star (mm).
star_height=15;
// Radius of the star's inner vertices.
inner_radius=20;
// Radius of the star's outer most edges.
outer_radius=45;

star();
star_holder();

module star_holder() {
        difference() {
        translate([0,outer_radius+1,0]) cylinder(r=4,h=1);
        translate([0,outer_radius+1,0]) cylinder(r=2.5,h=1);    
        }
}
module star() {   
        polyhedron(points=[
        [0, 0, star_height],

The bottom face is flipped, if you turn on "View -> Thrown Together" it will
show in pinkish color. Reversing the order of the points for those faces should
fix the issue.

Why does the direction of the face matter? What's on the inside and outside
appears obvious to me.

That worked. I guess I was looking at the bottom upside down.

Thanks!

I'm running OpenSCAD version 2014.03 on Windows from the pre-built 
executable.  From time to time I hit MinGW assertion failures.  For example,

/home/don/openscad_deps/mxe-w64/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/include/boost/smart_ptr/shared_ptr.hpp, 
Line 653

Expression: px!=0

which would seem to be a null pointer fault.  I'm wondering if handling such 
things a little more helpfully might contribute to usability and acceptance. 
I can certainly dig into source and find Line 653 to see what's going on but 
an error message (however cryptic) with a return to the top of the 
interpreter loop might be a little more graceful.

IMHO, as always.

Cheers, Scott

Scroll down the Downloads page and try one of the development snapshot builds before bothering with chasing it in the code. The 2014.03 build is quite old wrt where the code is at these days.

Confirmed this too. Scintilla was doing it correctly, so something changed.

Message-ID: <CADHqTOdVq0Zwex90xHjXQXXxw20x3B2wOfKx=SSp8Jd_9hq1QA@mail.gmail.com>

I am designing a box using mortise-and-tenon-style joinery in OpenSCAD.
This was pretty easy when I was designing for the laser cutter, since
inside corners come out nice and sharp. But now I have a Shapeoko 2, and I
have to cope with rounded inside corners.

Does anyone have any crafty ways of implementing corner relief in OpenSCAD?
I know that I can difference with a bunch of circles, but I'm hoping for
something less manual and crufty.

Have a look at  Offset()
<https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Other_Language_Features#Offset> 
, you will need the development snapshot.

Well, that took a bit less effort than I had expected (which probably means
it has more bugs than I expect). I've now updated the script to merge
triangles that have the same normal and share a common edge.

Offset looks cool, but I don't see how this will help me to automatically
place difference circles at inside corner vertices. Am I missing something?

I thought you wanted rounded corners. 

Now I know what a corner relief is,

clothbot made a generalized fillet() module which works on 3D geometries, using
some very clever magic with minkowski() (as a replacement for missing 3D
offset() functionality), intersection(), and hull().

I think you could probably implement a generalized corner relief function
somehow by adapting that fillet() module, but I'm not sure how.

I haven't quite figured out how one might do an obround corner relief, but
here's one geometric approach to doing (2D) circular corner relief:

https://github.com/clothbot/ClothBotCreations/blob/master/examples/corner_relief.scad

In a nutshell, I (ab)use the offset() operator to find the difference in
geometry between bevel and miter for a "significantly small value of
negative-delta", then do a minkowski with a circle to grow those bits of
differences to the "tool diameter".

Enjoy!

Andrew.

Just a heads up regarding offset(), the parameters will probably change slightly

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Center an Imported DXF

This has doubtless been asked and answered many times but darn if I can find 
the answer in the archive ...

How does one center an imported DXF, either before or after a linear 
extrude?  center=true on the linear_extrude does a z-axis center, of course, 
but it's no help on x and y.  Using dxf_dims would seem to be the Right 
Stuff but the DXF 'dims' seem to vary from DXF to DXF.

In the situation at hand, I load an EPS into Inkscape and then save as 1) 
Desktop Cutting Plotter, 2) Big Blue Saw DXF Output or 3) OpenSCAD DXF 
Output.  Each of these put different 'dims' into the DXF file none of which, 
as far as I can tell, can be used to center the DXF when it is loaded into 
OpenSCAD.  Furthermore, none of these DXFs seem to contain any support for 
dxf_cross.

I'm certainly missing something obvious. Thanks in advance for any insight.

Cheers, Scott

The font dialog is only slow when creating the font cache. This typically happens the first time you run OpenSCAD.

The cache typically resides in  C:\Documents and Settings\username\Local Settings\Application Data\fontconfig\cache.
If you remove it, it will take time to rebuild.

Hmm, right, I guess I missed the OpenCSG build script modification in my
log.

You mean the changes to the qmake files?

It's always mentioning the file, e.g. openscad.pro (main qmake file) or
glew.pri/boost.pri/... (imported by openscad.pro).

Essentially remove the lines starting with "-" and add those with "+".
It's basically a diff of the OpenSCAD directory after doing the changes
against the original github source.

ciao,
   Torsten.

Hi guys,

Not sure which program he is using, but I really like that you can see the

Ah, I was looking for a %localappdata%\OpenSCAD folder, didn't realize it was
just named fontconfig. When I emptied it OpenSCAD used 80 seconds to display
the dialog. Not so nice.

The challenge is that the DXF file touches the Y axis in one vertex. This causes the revolved volume to be non-manifold (volume collapses in one vertex). Unfortunately, our CSG engine doesn?t handle that.

repost:

Do you want to have a circle cut out at all inside corners of a 2d shape,
or do you want a sphere cut out at all inside 3d corners (like the inside
corners of a box)?

Or do you require more complex (or more simple) cut-outs?

If you just need the 2d circle cut out than I know an easy way:
use some way to make automatic fillets inside all the 2d corner, but set
the fillet-radius to something very small, then just do a minkowsky() of
the fillet and the circle you need cut out and difference() it from your
part.

For automatic 2d-fillet generation have a look at what I have on
Thingiverse:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:422252

If you want 3d corner reliefs that this method can be generalized to 3d.

Just post your part here and I`ll give it a go.

Sincerely,

TakeItAndRun

Right, got it. 

I've made all the changes, and have opened the project in Qt Creator. When
building I get:

That looks like it's not finding the file as it's doing an out-of-source
build (which I think is the default).

What's the project setting "General -> Shadow build"?

That should just point to the folder with the OpenSCAD source.

ciao,

The sourcecode is downloaded from GIT into C:\openscad\openscad

The Shadow build checkbox is on, and I've tried changing the path to both
C:\openscad\openscad and C:\openscad\openscad\src, but on both cases it
fails on "flex: can't open lexer".

Hi,

I mean that the _2D_ object touches the Y axis in one vertex. If you move
the 2D object a tiny bit in the positive X direction, it should work.

Ok, I finally got 2014.12.07 and the problem persists, though is a little
different.

Picking up the model and moving the mouse into the title area above now only
causes the viewport to zoom out partially - it's as if it is now limited by
*something*.

Panning is still "sluggish" compared to 2014.03 and requires excessive mouse
movement for on-screen displacement.

Sticky mouse button is still evident.

Crosshairs issue unchanged.

On a positive note, the erroneous warnings about functions have gone. :-)

Would you mind creating two separate github issues for these? We should definitely look into these before the upcoming release.
-> One for the sticky+zooming issue and another for the sluggish pan.

This was fixed before 2014.12.07. In my build, this works as it should. Could you double-check that you?re using the correct build?

Subject: [OpenSCAD] difference leaves color from object behind
Message-ID: <1418935983549-10615.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi, this is probably by design, but I was a bit puzzled after all.

od = 6;
width=3;
$fn=20;
difference() {
    color("grey") cylinder(d=od, h=width, center=true);
    color("red") cylinder(d=od-1, h=width+1, center=true);
}

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n10615/greyRedCylinder.png> 

When I remove the red cylinder the inside of the grey one becomes red. Is it
supposed to be like that?

Looks like the OpenCSG fixes didn?t make it to that page. It still tries to build examples and link with GLUT.

Is it a concern that the render stats are different from 2014.03 v's
2014.12.16

Message-ID: <418E69A0-91D9-4933-89D6-11AF92FD5D9B@icloud.com>

Hi all, I was generating a set of gears using the involute_gears library for use in RL 3D printing as well as SL (Second Life) virtual world object creation and I found the process to be quite laborious.  If it were possible to generate output files from within a for loop, this process would be greatly simplified.  Also SL imports only Colada files (*.dae), so I would want that output file type added to the list.  

I am offering a $100 bounty for whoever does this.  

I will look up bounty source and see if i can figure out how to do this.  I?ll ask for help if I have trouble.

Bounties are always cool - it?s both a motivator and a very good indicator of pain points :)

I would split this in two issues: multi-file output and Collada export.
Multi-file export is discussed here: https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/1041
Perhaps you could add to that discussion to help arrive at a good method for this.

Cheers,

Setting aside the file export mechanism, the 'batch process a series of
outputs' part of this request is the kind of problem that is potentially
well related to the parameterization topic discussed at  GitHub
<https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/722>   and the  forum
<http://forum.openscad.org/New-Language-Feature-Parameter-Information-to-generate-GUI-Forms-td10544.html> 
.

A lot of systems would address this problem by taking the approach of using
a glue-ware scripting tool like Python or shell scripts or somesuch to
execute an OpenSCAD command line that digests parameters.  

If the parameter mechanism (as suggested in points in the discussion,)
exposes the parameters via the command line then batch tasks like the one
described in this message could be executed by any of dozens of languages,
web tools, etc.  (you could do it today in a brute force, rewrite the .scad
via a script, manner.  Painful, but I do that kind of thing a lot in my
database development work.)

Don't get me wrong, file export functions in the OpenSCAD lexicon are
potentially really valuable, but command line parameter access is crazy
powerful.

I see your point about the command line parameters, and I would use that option if I knew how.  But I think it?s cool to put it either in the GUI or the code (my preference is the code) or both (best of all).  I added $50 to the existing $100 bounty on this.  I will try to figure out how to post a bounty to add .dae Colada files next for the remaining $50 part of the solution.  This bounty source thing is cool!  

Note that I will rarely ever donate more than $5 to an open source project to support it?s overall development, but I?m willing to throw a fist full of dollars at a specific item that I want.  Go figure eh?  

Les
p.s. and I?m a poor boy on disability so this is a lot of $ for me!

Sounds like tdeagan has the right idea for batch output. For file formats,
I'd add $50 for IGES export. Apparently it is CSG based. This would allow
import into solidworks of something other than STL, which is awful. Though
maybe collada support would help here.

Let?s combine our file formats, IGES and DAE for a total of $100 ($50 from each of us).  I can?t figure out how to post a bounty myself, so I must be told how to do it or  you can do it.

Sounds good. Does anyone want to work on these things for the bounty? Or
does anyone want to add to the dollar amount for someone adding DAE and
IGES support?

Please split such requests into multiple issues. IGES and DAE are very different beasts.

The reason for this is that we don?t currently quantize vertices before sending them to CGAL. We used to do this, and perhaps we should still be doing it.
It?s worth looking into.

The reason for this change is likely to be that we now use createNefPolyhedronFromPolySet() to feed data into CGAL:

This could also be the remaining part of https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/691

I haven't done one, but from observation; Your raise a Github issue  here
<https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/new>   mentioning the bounty
proposal, Marius sprinkles magic power, and the option of adding a bounty
appears against the issue, you can click on the link to do the formalities.

My apologies, I skimmed through my tests and got confused over which was the
correct/intended behaviour. This is indeed fixed in the latest build.

As an aside, I don't know if this is worthy of a mention: OSX won't show
more than one version of OpenSCAD in my launch pad - only the latest one
appears, despite them all being in my Applications folder and all having
execute permission granted in the security control panel. Is this related to
how the application is signed?

Superficially these appear to cover different use cases.

In the GUI it could be rather simple: The animation feature has a "dump
picture" feature. A dump model checkbox could be added next to it. Then you
draw your models in relation to $t. Doesn't have to be the same model
animated, it could be different models.

In the code, an stl() module could be added and work similar to render(),
except the output is saved to a file.

In either case you need to specify your needs _much_ more detailed than in
your first post. Else the chance is big you won't get what you want. Maybe
you can post a code example of what you would like.

Bananafofanapeel (heh, couldn?t resist), This seems reasonable with one exception - one might want to parameterize the files by more than one variable, in which case the $t would have to be decomposed by conditionals or logic to derive the separate variables, kinda messy.  Same for the code as was discussed on github/bountysource where we might have something like:  

for (x=[0;2], y=[0:1])
write(myModel(x, y), ?myFileName? . x . y . ?.dae, [params]);

where the dot (.) is the concatenation operator (I forget what it is in OpenSCAD) and the file format is taken from the extension plus the details of the file format are taken from the params (i.e. ascii vs binary for still).

@Bananapeel Your Idea is ingenious.
Lets add a check box to Animate to export the stl.
Animate would have to do an F6 instead of an F5, so. Is this possible?
This would not break any existing designs.
And if this feature gets implemented in the GUI later this could be
depreciated.
This is not the most convenient way to export different stl's but with a
little thinking it is sure doable.

Sincerely,

TakeItAndRun

Implementing already deprecated features does not sound like the best solution.

Also I really don't want to imagine how that would be explained in the documentation ;-)

If that feature is needed now, it's easily possible on command line without any changes
to OpenSCAD itself. Just call with -Dpart=x and use that in code. Why misuse $t for that?

ciao,

A (very short) explanation is there:
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Using_OpenSCAD_in_a_command_line_environment#Constants

Another simple example:

mode = 0;

module part1() {
     cube(20, center = true);
}

module part2() {
     cylinder(r = 5, h = 21, center = true);
}

module assembly() {
     difference() {
         part1();
         part2();
     }
}

if (mode == 1) {
     part1();
} else if (mode == 2) {
     part2();
} else {
     assembly();
}

Create a batch file (or shell script, or processing sketch, ...):

openscad -Dmode=0 -o all.stl params.scad
openscad -Dmode=1 -o part1.stl params.scad
openscad -Dmode=2 -o part2.stl params.scad

ciao,
   Torsten.

The trick of F5 for displaying the subtracted cylinder is to draw the
backside of the subtracted cylinder over the front side of the first
cylinder. Now the color of the subtracted cylinder is red. That`s why
cutouts get colored with the color of the subtracted object. No actual
geometry data is ever computed with F5. That`s what makes F5 so fast.

Sincerely,

Right, I forgot to document that part. But I did it manually on my machine,
so I don't think that causes that 'lexer' error.

Is there an easy way to apply the .patch file to avoid having to make each
change manually?

Yes, if you have the OpenSCAD sources cloned and made the changes, you can
generate the full diff using "git diff > file.patch".

This could then be applied by "patch -p1 < file.patch" again on clean sources.

I got one step further by running the flex command in msys2 bash:

 $ flex -P lexer -o src/lexer.lexer.cpp src/lexer.l

That ran without errors.

Now when I try to build in Qt Creator I get this error:

I see now that STL is generated in the export.cc code, so it would make
sense for a 3D SVG export (2D SVG is already there) to go in a similar
place:

https://github.com/openscad/openscad/blob/master/src/export.cc

But I can't see anything there about colour, and I'm a bit green to the
OpenSCAD data structures. Any ideas how colour can be pulled out the
objects?

I've been colourising images in Inkscape by setting the saturation and hue
to that of the desired colour, keeping the lighness the same as the surface
(assuming the fudged Inkscape model of colour). It would be possible to do
this in code, bearing in mind that the lightness component would be ignored
from the object colouring, but I need some way to get the colour out of the
objects -- it's definitely not in the STL file, and the current 2D SVG
export ignores colour completely.

Viewport camera angle shouldn't be too difficult -- it's just an application
of a matrix multiplication to all the 3D components.

Sorry, just noticed you've already done that -- for some reason I couldn't find your fork earlier. It's a nice idea to add it to the
existing SVG code and choose based on the model whether to do a 3D or 2D SVG export.

Looking at the code, it doesn't seem to combine polygons to exclude common edges with the same normal (i.e. not including my most recent
changes), and only calculates the normal based on the first three points (presumably assuming all polygons are triangles). Presumably
updates are in the works....

I think that's much nicer than just give an error "can't export 3D
model as SVG", even with it's currently a bit limited features.

At this point in the export, the polygons are usually not fully
tesselated, but all should be convex, so it depends on the previous
calculation steps what geometry is given to the export. I guess in
most cases (e.g. for the primitives or for extrusion) it's likely
quads.
The normal calculation could be made more stable by better selection
of the vertices. Do you have an suggestions what could work for that?
Using the vertices which have the greatest dot product value?

   Torsten.

Assuming all the vertices are coplanar (hopefully a reasonable assumption
to make), it shouldn't matter too much as long as there's sufficient
separation between the points. My gut instinct would be to select 3
vertices that differed in distance in all 3 dimensions by more than 1/4 of
the bounding box.

If all points are colinear, then the polygon probably shouldn't be
displayed, and if the normal is pointing away from the viewport, then the
polygon probably also shouldn't be displayed.

if we really want to support non-planar polygons, perhaps just use Newell?s method, as in:
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/blob/a05fe72c6bcc46450797ab6b87a3494c703d4d4d/src/cgalutils-tess.cc#L109

We can also tessellate before doing the export if that makes it easier.

Hi, 
I keep thinking that whenever a Warning or an Error occurs iti s hard to
notice those in the Console window.

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n10657/Warning.png> 

Would it be a good idea to either highlight those in color, or use some
other way to attract the attention of the programmer?

It is a bigger problem that errors often disappear and don't reappear until
the cache is flushed.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Crash on simple object rotation
Message-ID: <1419076288016-10660.post@n5.nabble.com>

I am using 2014.12.04 on windows and I am crashing on a what I think is a
simple object rotation and translation.  I have narrowed the problem down to
the fact that I am rotating an object twice (done this way for modularity in
a larger model). Is that a problem?  Here is the snippet that is giving me a
problem.


translate([0,14,.5]) head_clip();
rotate([0,0,90]) translate([0,19,.5]) head_clip();

module head_clip() {
	rotate([90,0,0]) translate([0,1.5,0]) cylinder(h=.5, r1=1, r2=1,
center=true);
	translate([0,0,.5]) cube([2,.5,2], center=true);	
}

I can probably find another way to do this, but I am curious why this is
giving me a problem.

Thanks.

It doesn't crash here on the same version. Must be a very subtle bug.

I had a similar effect on Linux yesterday, that crashed even with a simple

difference() {
	sphere(200);
	cylinder(r = 20, h = 500, center = true);
}

when exporting to STL. So it seems there's indeed something fishy going on.

Thanks to the MSYS2 developers, all dependencies needed for OpenSCAD are
available as MSYS2 packages now and can simply be installed using pacman.

I've updated the wiki page...
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Building_on_Microsoft_Windows

Note that there's still an issue with QScintilla crashing when using debug
build (error: "QWidget: Must construct a QApplication before a QWidget").

Anyone having an idea what's wrong there?

The release build does work.

ciao,
   Torsten.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Crash when using minkowski on my object
Message-ID: <1419107929232-10668.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi, I made an object, and then wanted to see what happened if I did a
Minkowski sum of the object with a small sphere. Since Minkowski is like
black magic to me I just wanted to see what happened, hoping for the corners
of my object being rounded.

The result was crashing OpenSCAD most of the times, and the other times I
got lots of these errors:

CGAL error in CGALUtils::applyBinaryOperator union: CGAL ERROR: assertion
violation!
Expr: G.mark(v1,0)==G.mark(v2,0)&& G.mark(v1,1)==G.mark(v2,1)

Line: 1102

The code used is:

depth=20; 
height=43; 
width=60; 
outerhole=20; 
innerhole=10;

minkowski() {
    difference() {
        cube([depth, width, height], center=true);
        translate([0,0,height/10]) rotate([0,90, 0]) cylinder(d=outerhole,
h=depth*2, center=true);
        translate([0, -width/2+(width/8.1), height/2.75]) cube([depth+1,
width/4, height/3], center=true);
        translate([0, width/2-(width/8.1), height/2.75]) cube([depth+1,
width/4, height/3], center=true);
        for (x = [-4,12])
            for (y = [-22,22])
                rotate([0,90,0]) translate([x,y,0]) cylinder(d=5.5,
h=depth+1, center=true);
        translate([0,-width/2+8,0]) cylinder(d=6.6, h=height+1,
center=true);
        mirror([0,1,0]) translate([0,-width/2+8,0]) cylinder(d=6.6,
h=height+1, center=true);
    }
    sphere(2);
}

Worth investigating? (Using 2014.12.18 on Win64 )

Compilation on MSYS2 should now work without any changes in the OpenSCAD sources.

Many thanks to Alexpux from MSYS2 for the help.

We might get a debug version from QScintilla as package too, that would enable
us to create debug builds later.

In the meantime it would require to build debug versions of the QScintilla
library.

ciao,
   Torsten.

You're lucky, it crashed OpenSCAD on my system. (OpenSCAD 2014.12.18, W7/64)

When I do F5/F6 it just hangs. This is because minkowski is a really slow
module(). Setting $fn=3; gave me a result after a while.

Strike that.

I'm not sure if minkowski is designed for something with a hole in it.

depth=20;
height=43;
width=60;
outerhole=20;
innerhole=10;

    difference() {
        minkowski() 
        {
        cube([depth-4, width-4, height-4], center=true);
        sphere(2);
        }   
        translate([0,0,height/10]) rotate([0,90, 0]) 
            cylinder(d=outerhole, h=depth*2, center=true);
        translate([0, -width/2+(width/8.1), height/2.75]) 
            cube([depth+1, width/4, height/3], center=true);
        translate([0, width/2-(width/8.1), height/2.75]) 
            cube([depth+1, width/4, height/3], center=true);
        for (x = [-4,12])
            for (y = [-22,22])
                rotate([0,90,0]) translate([x,y,0]) cylinder(d=5.5,
h=depth+1, center=true);
            
        translate([0,-width/2+8,-0.5]) cylinder(d=6.6, h=height+1,
center=true);
            
        mirror([0,1,0]) translate([0,-width/2+8,-0.5]) cylinder(d=6.6,
h=height+1, center=true);
    }

Doesn't round the cut-outs tho.

I hope I do not cause offense when I make mention of this, but I?ll risk it anyway.  

OpenSCAD is a tool.  As such it is intended to be used by someone with a reasonable amount of skill in the trade for which the tool is applied.  This means using the tool within normal limits or pushing those limits somewhat if only to understand what they are.  

Lately I have been seeing a lot of posts on the topic of ?I used my knife as a screwdriver and it broke? followed by ?should we fix this issue??.  The answer is ?No, never use a knife as a screwdriver.?.  

I hope you will pardon my attempt at humor and get my point which is:  I use the tool properly and have none of these issues.  You should too.

Looking at the STL in blender shows a large amount of non-manifold edges.
I'm not yet sure where those are coming from.

Les, no offense is taken :) I understand your point, but let me also make
mine.

Lets change your analagy a bit - OpenSCAD is a workshop. It has a workbench,
some powertools and some materials. I just picked up the minkowski-powertool
that I haven't really used before, used it on a block of wood, and suddenly
my entire workshop burned to the ground. I think we can all agree that
anything that causes the workshop to go up in flames deserves to be looked
at.

I would either have expected the result to look really weird, or perhaps
take a long time to compute, but certainly not kill the application.

Yes, I agree that I'm most likely misusing the tool. I also hinted at that
in the initial post. Your argument of "Just use the tool properly" assumes
that one knows how the tool works. A common way of figuring out how a
certain tool works is "lets just try it and see what happens". Trial and
error. I've read the documentation for minkowski(), and the definition of
the minkowski algorithm, but I will still need to just "take it for a spin"
before I see all the usecases where it is suitable to use. 

I find OpenSCAD a very interresting application, with a good community
spirit. Marius and Torsten do a fantastic job of listening to the users, and
I've seen several examples where feedback from users have been implemented
by them within minutes. My thought when sharing the crash-situation was that
they might see an issue that should be fixed, even though I admittely did
write funky code.

Michael, here is a simple example that has a hole in it, and where I think
minkowski serves a purpose.

minkowski() {
    difference() {
        cube([20,20,2]);
        translate([10,10,-1]) cylinder(h=30, r=5);
    }
    sphere(1);
}

Software should never crash, regardless of misuse.

I like your workshop analogy.  You got out a power tool and it hurt you.  There?s a saying ?Power tools maim?, and it is a warning and a reminder that we must be very careful when using such tools.  You?re not being careful, you?ve got a circular saw in your hands and you cut the cord with it.  Of course it broke.  The shop didn?t burn down, you can run OpenSCAD again, it just quit working cause you used it improperly.  

OK, silly analogies aside, I?ve noticed there are two kinds of computer users:  those who try to make software work and those who try to break it and then complain that it broke.  Which one are you?  

Just my perspective?

Message-ID: <1419162466749-10681.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi, 
the mirror() command is basically a method that moves and transforms an
object. I wish there was a way to also say that the initial object should
remain in place, while creating a mirrored copy.

Perhaps the mirror() command could have an optional copy=true parameter ?

mirror([0,1,0], copy=true) 
    union() {
        cube([10,30,2]);
        translate([5, 25, 0]) cylinder(h=10, d=6);
    }

Wouldn't that be useful?

That statement is going on your permanent record, young man!  

Of course software crashes.  This is free software.  You got it for zero dollars, so don?t complain when it crashes.  

I have known people with this attitude.  They are not the doers of the world, they are the skeptics, the nay-sayers who mock and taunt and jeer and criticize every little imperfection in the work of others when they have not ever accomplished anything themselves.  Don?t go down that path, go the other way - be someone who strives to achieve great things, because in the end you?ll look back on your life and feel much better about it.

Can't you just make a module that does that? Something like:

module copy_mirror(vec=[0,1,0])
{
    children();
    mirror(vec) children();
}

In most cases with OpenSCAD the problem is not OpenSCAD but the libraries
it uses. They have some very tight input requirements (or they break),
some significant performance problems (mathematicians write code for
correctness not performance), and very demanding rules about numeric
behaviour which mix in with this.

If you want OpenSCAD to fly and be solid in all cases write an
engineering not maths CSG library. One that tolerates small input
errors, deals with mathematical inaccuracy by whatever armwaving fuzzing
or grid snapping is needed and is prepared to be fast rather than
perfectly accurate. We can't print atoms (yet) so why worry about that
level of accuracy.

It's free software, you have all the pieces, send fixes!

Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining. Not at all. I'm just giving
positive feedback and engaging in a discussion. Being a software developer I
know that bugs are to be expected. But if no one says anything when they
happen then chances are they are not going to be fixed either.

Your comments could be interpreted like this; "OpenSCAD will only crash if
you do stupid things". If you look at the issue-database in GitHub I'm sure
you'll find more than enough examples where the application crashes even
though the user has written reasonable code.

You asked what kind of user I am; I am the one that wants OpenSCAD to
succeed. I want it to become the defacto standard CAD software for
programmers. For that to happen there needs to be a low threshold for
providing feedback in the community. If we set a standard where we're saying
that only experienced users can partake then we're headed in the wrong
direction. Let's not be a community where we scoff at "stupid" questions.

I appreciate the dicussion, Les :)

Reporting a crash in a software isn't "mocking and taunting," it's helping to
make the software better.

I think the reason it doesn't work is the polyhedrons have missing faces,
so are not manifold, so not a valid objects for CSG ops, the implicit union
in this case.

I think if you close them so they are actually polyhedrons it will work.

A crash due to a segmentation fault can occasionally be deliberately and
maliciously manipulated to not crash and excecute arbitrary code as the
user. If it's possible to produce an error prior to a crash (and, ideally,
avoid the crash entirely), then it is a good idea to do that.

Yes, bugs happen, all the time. One of my common phrases in emails when I
write code is something along the lines of "I have changed this code, so
expect odd behaviour and bugs, and please let me know when that happens."
That doesn't mean that known bugs (especially ones that halt a program)
should be ignored.

It doesn't look like Scalpel78 was particularly annoyed by this bug, and was
in an excellent position to report this bug because he found a [somewhat]
repeatable situation that caused OpenSCAD to crash. Bug reporting,
particularly with included examples (as is easy with OpenSCAD), is a good
idea, and I don't like discouraging people from doing that.

I can reproduce this on Mac - something goes wrong deep inside CGAL it seems. Usually, CGAL will throw an exception which can catch, and sometimes CGAL crashes hard. I?ll try to look into it and open a github issue.

You will find that Gregs approach can be used for a lot of what, on initial
view, seem to be shortcomings of the language.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Designing with OpenSCAD book
Message-ID: <1419204264392-10695.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi all,

I've been thinking about writing an OpenSCAD book for a long time now. I
finally bit the bullet a week or two ago. In the spirit of getting things
out early, I finished a couple short chapters to show. Here's a link to the
sample chapters I've completed already for building (part of) a model rocket
launcher.

https://leanpub.com/designing_with_openscad/read

Let me know what you think about whether it'd be useful for you, and
something that you'd like to read. What techniques would you like to learn,
and what you'd like to know about OpenSCAD.

If you're interested in the book, put your name and email address down here:

https://leanpub.com/designing_with_openscad

Thanks!

Wil

Okay, it's not a bounty attempt, but here is a Python script that will
execute a batch series of OpenSCAD command lines driven from a .csv file.  
You can use it to generate a set of images, a set of .STLs or whatever
formats are now or future supported.

The .CSV would would like this:

for an OpenSCAD file like this:

on Debian, the command

would generate (and optionally execute if the -x was missing,) a series of
command lines like this:

*Notes*:
- it's Python 3 (sorry, but I've moved on.  3 is the future.)
- it needs a recent version of OpenSCAD to be able to do things like render
(see  OpenSCAD docs
<http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Using_OpenSCAD_in_a_command_line_environment>  
for a list of which command line switches each version of OpenSCAD supports.
- call it with -h to get instructions (you can also read them in the source
below
- I've tested on Windows 8.1 and Debian 64 bit

The progress bar should be a "non-progressing bar". Not sure how that looks on Windows.
On Mac it looks smth. like this: http://alvinalexander.com/blog-files/4-du-progress.jpg

Just nosing around at the xxxxSCAD-like code mentioned, it looks like
implicitCAD is dormant for a couple of years now. Anyone know what happened
there? I tried building it on my system, but "implicit" is failing to build,
and I don't really see any good clues as to why. Don't know anything about
the Haskell environment, so probably it might be telling what's up...I just
don't see it.

The developers dropped it. I?ve talked to them, and it seems to be a combination of ?we proved it can be done, now it?s just a lot of work to make it solid? and ?we don?t really have time to maintain it?.
..so it?s basically waiting for someone to pick up the glove :)

I?m interested in exploring ways of moving OpenSCAD in the direction of F-Rep, but it?s significant work to create a good geometry kernel.

Thanks, I rather suspected it was not going anywhere, after two years of 
idle-ness. Was just interested in seeing what the g-code they claimed to 
generate looked like.

Message-ID: <1419460345470-10712.post@n5.nabble.com>

For some reason the screen capture shows the blinking at the left margin, but
on the live screen it is not visible, you can't see a flash, and the
highlighted block is the same width as the other highlighted block. So you
can't see the cursor.

Why don't you just describe things instead of posting videos?

Yes, I also noticed that issue. Especially difficult with narrow fonts.

Which color scheme? (Only snapshots >= 2014-12-21 are interesting)

Note that the color schemes are in separate files now, so if anybody
has a favorite color scheme, that's relatively easy to add.
We probably don't want to deliver thousands of color schemes, but
a couple more nice ones could certainly be added... :-)

Sorry, will do here also. I had the comments in a Github issue, just easier

I closed the pyramid polygon, then completely closed the "pie slice" and that
appears to have fixed the issue. Apparently you can't make a watertight
object from open polyhedrons, no matter how precisely their edges meet.

Great Christmas present!!  I want to report a successful basic release build
under Windows 8.1 using the new instructions!  I did have to rename my
Windows account from 'Tim Deagan' to 'tdeagan' since msys2 can't handle
spaces in the paths, but otherwise everything worked great.

Thanks for the help and docs!!  I'm going to pull the new dev that I'd
completed on my Debian VM down to the Windows environment and see if I can
keep that development going (I've got a nice View menu driven set of scaling
tics on the axes working there.)

cheers (and a happy holiday to all!)

Every time I save and preview my file in OpenSCAD, it repositions my cursor
to the top of the file. How do I stop this? It's driving me insane and
making it impossible to get any work done.

I'm using the 2013.02.28 version straight from the Ubuntu 12 repo. There
doesn't seem to be anything more recent, short of compiling it from
scratch. I tried the PPA, but that only seems to work for Ubuntu 14.

I'm sorry, I just noticed the pre-compiled Linux package on the downloads
page. I installed that, and it seems to work fine.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] How to difference shape with text?
Message-ID: <1419573284627-10724.post@n5.nabble.com>

How do you perform a boolean difference between a shape and a block of text?

I'm trying to model an "N" cutout of a cube.

Since OpenSCAD doesn't natively support text, I'm using Write.scad
(http://www.spolearninglab.com/curriculum/lessonPlans/hacking/resources/software/3d/openscad/openscad_write.html)
to create the "N" shape. This is simply:

    use <Write.scad>
    write("N");

and of course adding a cube makes it:

    use <Write.scad>
    cube(1);
    write("N");

>From how I understand the `difference` operation, differencing these two
should be simply:

    use <Write.scad>
    difference{
        cube(1);
        write("N");
    }

However, when I run this, the view pane turns black and nothing renders.
What am I doing wrong?

Try "difference()", but have a look at just the write so you know the size
and orientation of the N v's the cube.

BTW if you are using the dev snapshot see  text()
<https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Text>  . It is 2D, if
you want to use it for 3D you need to linear_extrude() it.

I'm using 2014.03, not the dev version. Is this not possible with the
stable version? I am using difference(), so I'm not sure what you mean by
"try difference()". I did have a typo in my original email, I meant to
include the parens. To keep it simple, I excluded the transformations. The
full code is:

use <Write.scad>
difference() {
    translate([-1, -1, -1]) {
        cube(6);
    }

    translate([0, 0, -3]) {
    scale([1.5, 1, 10]){
        write("N");
    }}
}

Commenting out the difference shows an N stretching out of the top of a
cube.

That works for me on 2014.03 (W7/64).

(I have the '!' as I had ther code in the editor too)

What is it doing for you?

Chris,

Awesome, thanks for the post!

As for dimensioning, do you mean that it's hard to tell how big something in
when reading your code? To understand better, is it because

1) You didn't break it out into logical modules, and would like to see
better practices in breaking out modules?
2) You want to query a module for its dimensions, and don't know how?
3) You want to be able to see the dimensions in the drawing itself, and
don't know how?

Thanks!

Wil

It went to you because (I believe) you are registered to this thread when you
posted, you don't see Chris because he is not registered to the mailing
list. I think that's what happens...

No your posts are not flagged.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Thin wall detection tools?
Message-ID: <549E3489.6030008@gmail.com>

I've been doing some work with OpenSCAD, and am finding myself wanting 
some sort of enhancement to the UI so I could at least identify wall 
sections arbitrarily thinner than some width (measured from normal to 
normal). While I guess a tool to highlight these with an STL, I think 
having it in the preview mode would be extremely helpful to designers. 
Anyone know offhand if this kind of information can be pulled from the 
CSG in a usable manner?

What'd be even cooler is some sort of design rules-check file. Optional, 
of course, but probably would be extremely helpful w/r/t designing with 
specific printers in mind (which I suspect is what 90% of us do with 
OpenSCAD who also have a 3d printer).

Unfortunately the geometry is not calculated in preview, so it doesn't know
how thin things are.

Could be helpful, along with a general 'rubber ruler thing' in Render mode
tho.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Compiling for 64 bit Sparc Solaris 10
Message-ID: <1419662012354-10741.post@n5.nabble.com>

I'd really love to have Openscad running on my Sun Blade 2500 but haven't
been able to find any precompiled binaries.  I downloaded the source but
only got as far as typing

$ sh builder.sh

which just got me "builder.sh test: argument expected"

This is for 64 bit Sparc Solaris 10.  I'll be the first to admit I know very
little about compiling source code in Unix and the README doesn't
specifically mention this platform.  Any help would be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks.

Since you specify the geometry you should know what the wall thickness is.
I use constants like min_wall and wall and use them for all geometry that
creates walls. For example this generates a simple storage box with rounded
corners and a known wall thickness.

$fa = 5;
$fs = 0.1;

height = 60;
length = 90 / 2;
width = 55;
wall = 2.2;
irad = 8;
orad = irad + wall;

difference() {
hull()
for(end = [-1,1])
for(side = [-1,1])
translate([end * (length / 2 - orad), side * (width / 2 - orad), 0])
cylinder(r = orad, h = height);
hull()
for(end = [-1,1])
for(side = [-1,1])
translate([end * (length / 2 - wall - irad), side * (width / 2 - wall -
irad), wall + irad]) {
cylinder(r = irad, h = height);
sphere(irad);
}
}

There is never any need to query geometry dimensions because you have
already specified them directly of indirectly. The trick is to make the
dimensions that matter explicit constants and calculate the rest from
those. Sometimes you need a bit of high school trigonometry, for example a
sloping wall of a funnel.

In general that should be possible, but there are probably no fitting settings
for the build scripts. It may take some digging to find the correct parameters
and amend the scripts.

The best fitting steps would be:
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/#building-for-linuxbsd-on-systems-with-older-or-missing-dependencies
But it's not too likely the scripts will just work, e.g. the first script
(setenv-unibuild.sh) tries to detect various different Unix variants and
sets the correct values.

Is the system already having development tools like the GNU C/C++ compilers,
make and so on?

ciao,

I thought of that. For many people I think your solution becomes more
trouble than it's worth when considering difference'ing multiple oddball
shapes, or ones you don't have the explicit dimensions (imported stls come
to mind).

Additionally I feel that the purpose of a ui is to make certain things
easy. And to reduce the time spent between iterations of a design.
Obviously I wouldn't expect this kind of help when running as a script :D.

An external tool would be fine for people who just get stls off of thing
verse or youmagine.

My example comes from the Virtuoso EDA software package from Cadence. It
has as part of its work flow a design rule check script that can be run on
a layout. Newer version has an interactive version which is a huge time
saver.

Just trying to take some of the guess work out of making models to print.

I have some experience with compiling random things on Solaris 10.

On Solaris 10 /bin/sh is really that, not bash. The builtin test is not as
featured as bash. Or it's csh or ksh. Need to run the script with real
bash. If that doesn't work or bash isn't installed, need to install a
recent version. Good luck with that.

First you need to make sure you have a compiler. Oracle makes one and gcc
or g++ have packages for sun. Once you have a working compiler, time to get
the correct library version of everything and hope it doesn't break
backwards compatibility. I think most of the third party sites have mostly
dried up at this point.

In short, it is a pain to get a lot of new software running on an old os
like Solaris 10.

If you aren't tied to Solaris (and I really hope you are not), consider the
sparc debian linux distro or freebsd, which I think still has an active
sparc build.

Iirc that system is pretty old! 6 years?

OpenSCAD is capable of being its own DRC engine, after a fashion:

https://github.com/clothbot/ClothBotCreations/blob/master/examples/design_rule_checks.scad <https://github.com/clothbot/ClothBotCreations/blob/master/examples/design_rule_checks.scad>

Aside: Until there?s a 3D variant of offset(), you have to kludge it with something like the inner_offset_3d() in this example, but it gets the job done.  Ideally, you?d offset(delta=delta) offset(delta=-delta) children() to trim off all geometry thinner than 2*delta, assuming orientation doesn?t matter (e.g. thinner delta in X-Y may be different than in Z).

Technically, the DRC features you?d be using in Virtuoso would be coming in by way of GDS export to PVS, Assura and/or Calibre.  Export STL and run ?OpenSCAD DRC scripts?, then import() the resulting geometry back into your original design with color() for context would be similar in behaviour to what you?re used to.

Thanks for the link, I will have to study it.

You're right, in our environment it is assura providing the drc engine (and
a different package for parasitic extraction, can't remember what it was
called). Unfortunately to all of my users (local Admin for the EDA packages
from Cadence and Synopsys), everything is "cadence" from ncvhdl to
simvision, to spectre and qrc.

I do have make and I did manage to get gcc installed.  It's sounding like
this isn't going to be easy, but I really would like to have it.

Unfortunately, I am.  The primary purpose of this machine is to run
Interlisp-D which AFAIK only runs in Solaris/Sun OS.

/"Iirc that system is pretty old! 6 years?"/

Ha - I wish.  2005.  But with two Sparc IIIi 64 bit 1.6 GHz CPUs it still
runs rings around lots of modern PC's.  The XVR-1200 graphics card will
support two 1920x1200 monitors and even has an output for stereo glasses..

Perhaps I should explain.  I have a degree in CS and I've been using Suns
since the days of the Sun 4 but I'm primarily a Lisp programmer.  I know
enough about Unix to do simple stuff and I did manage to install Solaris 10,
set up an account, get the networking running, start VNC, install gcc and
stuff like that, but when it comes to wading through long make files, I will
cheerfully admit I need help.  And with this one, I don't even know where to
begin.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Combining polyhedrons to make a solid
Message-ID: <1419704207696-10750.post@n5.nabble.com>

Is it possible to combine 2D objects to make a solid? I have some complex
polyhedrons that combine, with all faces facing outwards, to make a solid.
However, they don't show in F6. Strangely, a single polyhedron will show in
F6, even though it is not solid, but when the edge coincides with another
polyhedron they both disappear. Here is a simple example of a cube made out
of two polyhedrons:

polyhedron(
          points=[ [0,0,0],[10,0,0],[10,0,10],[0,0,10],
                   [0,10,0],[0,10,10],
                   [10,10,10],[10,10,0]
          ],                                 // the apex point 
          faces=[[0,3,2,1,0], [0,4,5,3],[5,4,7,6,5],[1,2,6,7,1],
          [0,1,7,4,0]
          ]
         );
polyhedron(
          points=[ [0,0,10],[0,10,10],[10,10,10],[10,0,10]
          ],                                 // the apex point 
          faces=[[0,1,2,3,0]]
         );

It could be shorthand for the Bourne shell or the bean shell. I don't 
think bash was installed by default on 10. Also, which subversion did 
you have installed? Sun/Oracle had multiple updates to the system. I 
think 10/09 was the last one.

Most software doesn't write everything on its own -- it relies on blocks 
of code other people have written. These are the dependencies.
The short list is in 
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Building_on_Linux/UNIX#Installing_dependencies, 
but I don't know how old that is.
If you can get scripts/setenv-unibuild.sh and 
./scripts/uni-build-dependencies.sh to run for you then you're most of 
the way there.

There's a host of places where it could fail though, mostly due to the 
dependencies failing to compile for one reason or another (largely 
because the compilation WorksForMe(tm) on the majority of people with 
x86 systems and it wasn't tested on a SPARC *and* someone got clever 
with their assumptions w/r/t pointers. Hopefully everything just works 
for you, but I'd definitely run the regression tests to be sure.//

But if you're getting issues from test, you probably need to figure out 
what the differences in syntax for your program

Medeley, right? I found this Interlisp interpreter with source at 
http://algorithms.us/software/lispf4/index.html, hopefully it's helpful!

I had to maintain a lab of Solaris 10 SPARC systems. The newest ones 
were a Ultra45s, the majority were older SunBlade150s and SunBlade100s.

Wikipedia: "In elementary geometry, a polyhedron (plural polyhedra or
polyhedrons) is a solid in three dimensions with flat faces, straight edges
and sharp corners or vertices."

Both of your polyhedrons are actually invalid (they aren't solids), which is
why it doesn't work.

Ok, so I was afraid of that. The problem arises if you want to create a 3D
object, made of many individual 2D polyhedron parts that is only solid when
all the parts are combined. Creating one huge polyhedron would create a huge
list of points and point references in the faces. Designing and
troubleshooting that can be a nightmare. Editing it would be even worse
since all the face references might need to be adjusted. 

To address this I created a function to combine multiple individual
polyhedrons into one large polyhedron. This way all the point references in
the individual polyhedron faces will only reference their own points. In
case anyone else has the same issue here is my function. Below is the simple
example from above created from two separate [point, faces] lists. Each
polyhedron can be rendered separately while designing (try it by using
polyhedron(points=poly1[0], faces=poly1[1]) but is combined to make the
final solid. This does F6!

//input is a list of [points, faces]
//For each faces, increment the point references by the previous number of
points
function combine_polyhedrons(list, points=[], faces=[], point_count=0, i=0)
=
    i < len(list) ? 
        combine_polyhedrons(list,
            concat(points, list[i][0]),
            concat(faces, [for (face_i = [0:len(list[i][1])-1])
                [for (point_i = [0:len(list[i][1][face_i])-1]) 
                    list[i][1][face_i][point_i] + point_count]]),
            point_count + len(list[i][0]),
            i + 1)
        : [points, faces];
            
//Each poly is [points, faces]
poly1 = [[ [0,0,0],[10,0,0],[10,0,10],[0,0,10],
           [0,10,0],[0,10,10],[10,10,10],[10,10,0]
         ],
         [ [0,3,2,1,0], [0,4,5,3],[5,4,7,6,5],[1,2,6,7,1], [0,1,7,4,0] ] 
        ];                
poly2 = [[ [0,0,10],[0,10,10],[10,10,10],[10,0,10] ],
         [ [0,1,2,3,0] ]
        ];
                
new_polyhendron = combine_polyhedrons([poly1, poly2]);
polyhedron(points=new_polyhendron[0], faces=new_polyhendron[1]);

If your final polyhedron is convex, you can take the hull of the partial ones.

Cool.  I had an Ultra 10 before I got this machine.  I used to have pizza
boxes on my desk at work.  Everything from the SparcStation 1, then 1+, 2,
5, 10, and finally 20.  Getting Openscad on the 2500 would help relieve the
computational load on my already overburdened PC.

Do you have gnu make installed? And are the scripts calling bin/bash or
bin/sh?

You would need to install subversion or git (preferably git) from source or
a sunw package

I would use the latest master. I will be hard to troubleshoot an older version.

I think most scripts assume that the system shell is also bash. Try forcing bash by adding this to the top:
#!/bin/bash

> # ./scripts/setenv-unibuild.sh
> ./scripts/setenv-unibuild.sh: cannot execute

You?re not supposed to execute that script, but source it:
$ . .scripts/setenv-unibuild.sh

I would strongly recommend teaming up with someone who has significant experience with Solaris and build systems. Porting to a new platform could be challenging and take significant time. ..but who knows, you might get lucky :)

Yay!
Please keep feeding examples to this list.
Also keep in mind that we?re almost done with the next release, so don?t be afraid to use the new features.

Btw., I see that your screenshots have that annoying black highlight bug. I believe we fixed back in August. Have you tried the development snapshots?

Cheers,

Yeah, /bin/sh isn't /bin/bash on Solaris 10, so far as I can remember. 
You will need to change #!/bin/sh to #!/bin/bash on the scripts. And 
remember to source the environment script (as the entry on the wikibook 
says).

> *-bash-3.2$ which make

To figure out what make you have, try "make -v". Should say "GNU Make" 
right at the top if it's gnu make.

http://git-scm.com for source tarballs. Once that's compiled/installed, 
checkout a copy of the master branch using the instructions at 
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Building_on_Linux/UNIX#Building_OpenSCAD_yourself 
and start working your way down. The instructions assume you have sudo 
installed. If not (and using sudo is a good idea in general), drop down 
to root privs before running the install target for make.

You will probably have to build the dependencies yourself (details are 
there on the wiki).

OK, I thought that's what I had.  Where do I get the latest version?

Unix experts is now basically none.

Sure, and I might win the Powerball too :-)  I probably have about the same

feel like I'm stuck in a maze of twisty little passages, all of them
different.  If anyone reading this thread would like to help me on this
project, I'd be very grateful.  Otherwise, I guess it will just remain a
dream.

You have an old version of grep. I?d install a newer version, or GNU grep.
You can probably safely remove the -q option though.

Hmm, which version of bash are you using? I?d recommend at least 3.x. I?m using 3.2. Most Linux users should be on 4.

His version of bash is 3.2. I know that his version of grep is not gnu. Awk
is going to be similarly different. Everything on Solaris is just different
enough to be frustrating to port stuff written for Linux on it; sun doing
things the Apple way. Although to be fair it was more like the Bad old days
of yore where you had to make your own cpu to be a Real computer company.

I worked a few years ago to get stuff compiled from source working on
Solaris 10 sparc. It was so painful that the machines were replaced with
Linux x86 systems as soon as we knew that the EDA tools we needed ran on
Linux x86. Newer core 2 systems were faster cheaper and more reponsive
anyway than the ultra45s.

Anyone who has such an old workstation and wants to use it is best advised
to become proficient in the black arts in order to keep it running. If I
had access to a system with your configuration I might be able to get it
compiled.

I think we had this discussion before and I thought pretty much the same as you do. However,  IIRC, the result was that this should be a part of the printer software. As it would be totally different from printer to printer.
Ideally you draw in OpenSCAD the perfect ideal geometry and if you ask for a 0.001 mm wall thickness, OpenSCAD should just create this. 
Within the next step, most likely within your printer software you could run some DRC against the capabilities of the particular printer.
I can easily see, that this is not ideal, if you want to have some feedback during the design stage (switching between different programs and even possibly different machines). 
Thus, the question would be should OpenScad get an entire new feature branch "DRC"? People could contribute rule sets for printers and by time, someone could design something entirely 3d printer agnostic, run the DRC check for a certain printer get some feedback and make necessary adjustments to the design. Later, one could take the same basic design and with the help of another rule-set adopt it for a different 3d printer.
Wall thickness would be just one parameter to check for. Clearing, minimum feature size, build volume, etc. would be other parameters. 

Why should this be part of OpenSCAD? Because people could test the designs for a certain printer even without having access to one (or its software). That would make business of 3d print on demand much easier.
Very similar situation exist for printed circuit board design. One can download  set of DRC-rules from a manufacture and load them in the PCB design software. Those help to spot problems which might occur during manufacturing at that given company.

Guess the same would be valid for OpenScad and the  3D printing world.

The only problem I see, there are not enough resources (contributors) to implement such  feature.

Greetings

Well I went to 
www.opencsw.org/manual-for-administrators/getting-started.html
<http://www.opencsw.org/manual-for-administrators/getting-started.html>  
and executed the commands there.

And to my complete astonishment, they worked!  I have now officially entered
some commands that did NOT throw an error.  So I guess I now have git.  In a
stock market blog I read it was once said that you should strive to achieve
at least one small victory every day, no matter how minor it might seem.  I
think this was my victory for today :-)

F5 works on 2014.03, F6 does not,

Both F5 & F6 work on latest snapshop.

I think the problem is you don't need to repeat the first vertex in the
faces list. If I remove all the last numbers it works fine in F5 and F6 in
the old versions I use.

It gives me an CGAL error in 2014.12.04, so there is probably something wrong
with your polyhedron. nophead pointed out the problem.

Fix:
f = [[0, 3, 2, 1], [0, 4, 5, 3], [5, 4, 7, 6], [1, 2, 6, 7], [0, 1, 7, 4],
[8, 9, 10, 11]]; 

Rendering Polygon Mesh using CGAL...
CGAL error in CGAL_Nef_polyhedron3(): CGAL ERROR: assertion violation!
Expr: pe != 0

Same with OpenSCAD version 2014.11.28 / OpenSUSE 13.1

and

have you noticed that the second face in the face list consists of 4
values but all others of 5 values ? The mismatch of numbers may cause
the problem - I didn't check.

@nophead I removed the extra vertices and made all the faces five points. It
is now a basic cube, 8 vertices and 6 faces. It still doesn't F6 on
2014.11.09. How did you get it to work?

p = [[0, 0, 0], [10, 0, 0], [10, 0, 10], [0, 0, 10], [0, 10, 0], 
     [0, 10, 10], [10, 10, 10], [10, 10, 0]]; 
f = [[0, 3, 2, 1, 0], [0, 4, 5, 3, 0], [5, 4, 7, 6, 5], [1, 2, 6, 7, 1], [0,
1, 7, 4, 0], [3, 5, 6, 2, 3]]; 

union() { 
    polyhedron(points=p, faces=f); 
    cylinder([1,1,1]); 
}

I removed the repeated vertex indices in faces. To define a square you need
four indices. You don't repeat the first one to close it.

nophead is right.
We made face tessellation more robust ca. Dec 1st., so any snapshot after that should work.

"Medeley, right? I found this Interlisp interpreter with source at
http://algorithms.us/software/lispf4/index.html, hopefully it's helpful!"

Yes.  That pointer is for Interlisp though.  I'm running Interlisp-D,
Xerox's version of Interlisp that features a full GUI that includes all
sorts of handy features like a syntax-directed editor.  Interlisp-D releases
came to be known by musical terms: Intermezzo, Lyric, and finally Medley. 
Medley was the end of the line.

PARC still has an ftp server with working Interlisp-D images for Sparc for
free here  ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/lfg/

Hmm, I just downloaded the latest PC version, 2014-03,and while it no longer
highlights the entire line the error is on, it's still pure red over black
text which is very hard to read.  A lighter color would make it easier to
see for example if the problem is a } instead of a ].  Perhaps this could be
a choice in Preferences -> Editor?

You should try the latest development snapshot; 2014.12.25 - it contains a lot of color fixes.

Wow!  That is very cool indeed.  It looks like Matlab now - neat.  I guess
"snapshot" was the magic word.  It would not have occured to me to look
under that tab otherwise.  I'd say problem solved :-)  Thanks!

Subject: [OpenSCAD] GIT integration?
Message-ID: <1419804991406-10784.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi, has anyone thought about adding GIT integration into OpenSCAD?

I keep thinking that I'd like to commit code from OpenSCAD directly into
GIT. Perhaps the integration could require GIT Bash to be installed on the
machine, and just call into that?

There are good external tools for this. Not sure if it?s worth doing a lot of GUI work to make this happen.
One good start to investigate this would be to enumerate existing code editors / IDEs with git integration and see what good workflows exist.

What is wrong with git-gui or any of the other gui tools?

I use git all the time. Wouldn't it be more reasonable to put together
something to use openscad with a more featured editor system like eclipse
than tacking on stuff like git integration  (duplicating a lot of effort in
the process)?

Wonder if the source could be pried out of someone's hands...

If you can get the old Solaris version of GNOME installed and running (if you haven?t already) you may have better luck satisfying all the other dependencies.

That?s what I found worked best when ?in the field? with a Tadpole RDI Ultrabook, back in the day. :-)

I never even saw that myself, and I worked for Xerox.  That would certainly
be the Holy Grail of Interlisp-D.

Well I'm currently running the Java Desktop Environment, which is just Gnome
plus Nautilus.  Or do you specifically mean some older version from an
earlier Solaris?

I'm still looking at that page on "Building OpenSCAD yourself".  I've gotten
as far as getting git installed, which is something I suppose.

I just downloaded the new development build, and it looks like it's fixed!
Thanks!

I'll redo the screenshots with the new version. Are there other topics you'd
like to see covered?

Ah, I see. Is it that core problem is related to dimensioning, which is--how
do I align different components correctly in an assembly?

I think I have a solution, which I'll try out, and get back to you. I think
I should be able to specify vectors where the holes are, and have OpenSCAD
figure out where to move them to make the assembly.

below you can find the formula to calculate the volume from the triangles (faces). I am not a programmer, but skilled enough to test it with Javascript. It works fine but I can't put it inside OpenScad. If somebody could implement it, it would be fine to see the result not only as part of the message window, but also offering the opportunity to export the result in any way, so I can make use of it in our software.

Cheat's way:  Open it in a slicer for 3d printing, set to 100% infill, no
raft, brim or support, and from the estimate of quantity of filament used,
get the volume...

Yes.  I can do it easily outside of OpenSCAD.  But that was not what I 
asked.

WOW, that's an overkill. ADMesh gives you the volume (precise, not this magic).

Using the 2014.12.25 build I find myself in this situation after previewing
several times:

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n10798/Yellow.png> 

Seems like it treats everything as warnings. 

Note, it worked fine in the beginning. I was moving my .scad files over to a
new folder. Moved the main one, opened it, previewed it, correctly got
yellow lines on the missing dependency-scad files, moved those over,
previewed again, got more correct yellow warnings. Moved more files, until
all problems where fixed. At that point it treated everything in the Console
as warnings.

Thanks both, I learned something useful to me from that... I use slic3r all the time but have been using MakerBot more recently

Now that we have concat(), list comprehensions as well as better recursion handling, it opens the door for a whole new class of objects.
See here for some ideas that have been explored: https://github.com/openscad/list-comprehension-demos

Then there is text() and offset().

See also here for preliminary release notes: https://github.com/openscad/openscad/blob/master/releases/2014.QX.md

Subject: [OpenSCAD] 2014.03 on Debian 7.7 preview rendering problem (some
 facets 100% white)
Message-ID: <1419902930409-10803.post@n5.nabble.com>

OpenSCAD 2014.03 on Debian 7.7 renders some facets incorrectly 
in the preview window, and the axes are unlabelled (should show X Y Z).
Here is an example showing the problem
https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ojCJY79vWDQ/VKH9U3q7dbI/AAAAAAAAD-Q/HNOOUecOF0M/s512/OpenSCAD-problem.jpg

Most of the model appears as expected, but a subset of facets appear full
white. 
The problem appears on all .scad files.

Computer:
  Debian 7.7 (wheezy) 64-bit
  Linux 3.2.0-4-amd64
  GNOME 3.4.2
Video Card:
  NVIDIA G98 [GeForce 8400 GS] with Nouveau driver
Display:
  Resolution 1280x1024 pixels
  OpenGL Renderer:  Gallium 0.4 on NV98
  
$ lspci -nn | grep VGA
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation G98 [GeForce
8400 GS] [10de:06e4] (rev a1)


At first I assumed it was just the Nouveau driver or OpenGL renderer was
broken. 
But as a check, after doing this:
http://askubuntu.com/questions/299345/how-to-enable-webgl-in-chrome-on-ubuntu

...I found that this WebGL 3D rendering demo works OK (Chrome browser):
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/formula1-using-threejs

Last month when this computer was still running Windows XP, I did not see
this problem; I had OpenSCAD 2014.03 rendering OK.  

I am reluctant to switch out Nouveau for the NVIDIA proprietary driver
because everything else works.  I have tried the NVIDIA driver before on
this box in several different Ubuntu and Debian installs and the computer
would not often even boot up after a suspend, or sometimes even a cold
reset.

Could you please try if the snapshot version shows the same issue?

See http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html#snapshots-linux-auto for details.
The package and binary are called openscad-nightly to make them installable
in parallel to the normal release version.

I think your argument is balanced, and I too err on not putting too much
into OpenSCAD.

Is there a way to push this off into a plugin system? So a 3rd party
plugins that can be loaded to do things like thin wall detection? That
might be even more work at first, however, and like you said, limited
coding resources and all.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Export image to file?
Message-ID: <1419935449424-10806.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi, I'm trying to export an image from OpenSCAD to file. 

Using the commandline options I've executed this:

"%PROGRAMFILES%\OpenSCAD\Openscad.com" -o ballbearing.jpg --imgsize=256,256
--preview ballbearing.scad

The only thing that happens is that OpenSCAD displays the usage text. No
information about what is missing, or what it doesn't understand. 

What am I doing wrong?

I guess you have to use filename with .png extension. That way
OpenSCAD recognizes you want an image (it does not AFAIK support JPEG
images)

If OpenSCAD does not support JPG, does it emit an error message somewhere?

The problem seems to be the --preview argument. It expects either
--preview=false or --preview=true. When just calling --preview it fails
without a useful error message.

Thank you very much for that link! I can confirm that the rendering bug is

(git bebe084) 

Now back to being a happy OpenSCAD user!

Message-ID: <1419969937701-10813.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi,
I'm seeing this pop-up box at program start-up telling me that rendering may
not work with the openGL version on my system. Here is the current config:
GLEW version 1.10.0
Mesa DRI Intel(R) G33 x86/MMX/SSE2 (Intel Open Source Technology Center)
OpenGL version 1.4 Mesa 10.1.0

Can anyone tell me how to upgrade (if possible) with the basic x86cpu video
hardware? I don't have a separate graphics card installed in this older pc.

Thanks,
Bill Martin

That is a warning. Is something not actually working as expected?

That?s an ancient GPU. I think your best way out is to install a software-only renderer, e.g. install a recent Mesa manually.

Just a reminder. With text() no longer experimental that panel is empty.
Perhaps it should be hidden for the release?

Yes, the problem is that the preview parameter takes an optional parameter, i.e. --preview or ?preview=throwntogether.
Since we don?t actually have a way determining the absence of a parameter unless the ?preview options comes last, this may fail.

Workaround: Always pass the preview option _after_ the main .scad file on the cmd-line.

Not sure how easy it would be to fix this.

The panel is only visible for development builds, so it will go away.

This undoubtedly shows my Git ignorance (I've always worked in SVN/CVS shops
and projects, OpenSCAD is my first Git experience,) but can someone share
the reason that these files aren't tracked or in the .gitignore:
        Makefile.Debug
        Makefile.Release
        object_script.openscad.Debug
        object_script.openscad.Release
        openscad.exe
        release/
        src/lexer.lexer.cpp
        src/parser_yacc.cpp

I'm really liking Git, they're going to hate me at work when I come back
from vacation and terrify them with the idea I might make us switch from
SVN.  It was already my April Fools joke on the team this last year and they
didn't think it was funny then (I did :-)  For us it would be a significant
re-tooling (Puppet, Rundeck, Jenkins, Jira/Greenhopper, Tortoise, Ankhsvn,
RedGate, etc. are all working nicely with SVN for us) but maybe I can start
a new project up with it...

Message-ID: <1420014287221-10821.post@n5.nabble.com>

Using Debian 7.7 x64, OpenSCAD 2014.12.30.nightly (git bebe084)

I made a simple typo which caused a module to reference itself, instead of
another module. There was a long string of "Error - recursion detected in
[x]" messages in the console pane, followed by a lot of disk activity (swap
space use?) and at that point the system was essentially locked up and I
could not close or quit the program; I had to reboot to escape.   It was my
fault for the unwanted recursion, but ideally I would not to have to reboot
to recover.  I've never tried to use recursion intentionally. Maybe there
could be a flag to turn the recursion feature off? Or is there already?

I've had similar on Windows, I set my swap space to a fixed amount (2GB),
thus when it is full OpenSCAD crashes, rather than the system hanging. Not
sure if that is possible on Linux.

Yes it should handle it properly, there have been some changes in this area
recently.

This shouldn?t have been fixed. Could you provide an example .scad file so we can reproduce it and look into it?

You don't have to reboot to recover. If your disk i/o is slow, you just have to
wait. It might be a long wait, though. :D

On the bright side, there are SysRq keys that can save you the wait:

Alt+SysRq+f: Trigger the OOM killer (Think Russian Roulette with a bias on
high-memory-consumption processes until OpenSCAD dies)

Alt+SysRq+k: Kill the entire TTY (Xorg and everything that depends on it,
including OpenSCAD).

These are all related to the new Windows build system and we didn?t yet add them to .gitignore

Where do these come from? To my knowledge, these files should not be written to the src/ folder. If they?re written to the correct location, they?ll be ignored.

> I'm really liking Git,

Once you switch you won?t switch back. The git workflow is, IMO, far superior to the centralized svn-style systems.
More recent svn versions do have better branching behavior then earlier though, so it?s not as much of a magic switch as it used to be.
A lot of corporate users tend to choose Mercurial over git. Not sure why.

Hmmm.  Weird.  I found them in my clean master branch and in a seperate
clean clone I did of the OpenSCAD/OpenSCAD master branch.  But I didn't
check until after I did a build of each of these, so perhaps they're
emerging from the Win build somehow?

I'll do another clone of the master later today and check before and after/

I woud like to add a vote for making this configurable.  I'd prefer that it
remember my last saved directory instead of always displaying the
installation directory.  This could be a Preferences item just like Firefox
lets you choose where to save downloaded files.  It's really annoying to
have to keep navigating back to my own directory every time I export an STL.

I'm not sure if that's still required.

Interesting. Given that those shouldn?t even be used I don?t see why they?d be needed.
Unless there are other places those files are messed with..

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Wish - error() and warning()
Message-ID: <1420064127189-10840.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi, 
I wish it was possible to write our own warnings and errors to the console
from the scad script. 

Typical usage could be:

module test(value) {
  if (value < 10)
    warning("Value less than 10 is a bad idea.");

  if (value < 0)
    error("Value less than zero are not valid");
}

The error() could perhaps include a stop=true parameter, which would halt
the script execution. 

What do you think? Are there exiting methods in place already that I've
missed?

I totally agree.  I've been advocating this for a year.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Functions with returnvalue?
Message-ID: <1420065406870-10842.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi, this might be a stupid question, but looking through the documentation I
couldn't find the answer.

Does OpenSCAD have a way of defining a function which has a returnvalue?

I'd like to do something like this:

function multiply(a, b) {
	return a*b;
}

or 

function substring(string, start, length) {
	 substring = "";
	for (i = [start : start+length])
		substring = string[i];
	return substring;
}

I was actually looking for a substring() method so that I could grab parts
of a string, and then that turned into a hunt for making my own function for
it, but I can't see any way to create functions.

All functions have a return value but they are a single expression, not a
procedural body so no return statement.

function multiply(a, b) = a * b;

For iteration use recursion or list comprehension.

function function substring(string, start, length) = start < length ?
concat(string[start], substring(string, start + 1, length) : "";

I think, not tested.

This one works:
function substring(string, start, length) = start < length ?
str(string[start], substring(string, start + 1, length)) : "";


echo(substring("abcdef", 2,4));

ECHO: "cd"

Bounty's seem to get features done quicker.

But in Windows I just set the default directory (in the properties of the
shortcut that runs OpenSCAD) to my source file. I imagine there is an
equivalent in Linux.

I want my source in one [default] folder and my STLs in a different 
folder, so this approach will not work.

I would prefer that the first time I save an STL, and I change the 
folder, the program remember that preference, at least until I close the 
program.  Or, better still, forever.

This seems neither difficult nor contentious.  But I have been wrong before

It messes things up for the other half of the world who keep their STL
files with the source code.

You probably won't like this, but if you make the STL folder a sub-folder of
your source, it is only one click away.

/"It messes things up for the other half of the world who keep their STL
files with the source code."/

Not if it's made a Preferences item with the current behavior the default. 
There are many many other programs that work this way including Firefox
which I already mentioned, Matlab, the XnView image editor, and Corel Draw,
to name a few.  What exactly is the advantage gained by the current
behavior?

Keeping your stls with the source code is fine - IF Openscad is the only 3D
CAD program you use.  If not, /somebody /has to have their stl's in a
different directory.  Or you end up with n different places where stls might
be and that way lies madness.  Why not just offer this as an option?  People
who like the way it is now wouldn't be bothered in the least.

Why not have two default folders: source and STL (or Export).  Then 
anyone can set them up any way they wish.

Done

The issue I've been having is another wrinkle to this problem. I usually have several OpenSCAD documents open at once, and frequently open one briefly to reference it in the middle of long-term work on another. When I try to export an STL, OpenSCAD always defaults to the folder of the last .scad file I opened, which is rarely the folder of the current document. I usually want the STLs in the same folder as the .scad, and would like it to default to the location of the CURRENT document, not the last-opened document as it does now. In any case, the desired location of the STL file will be based on the location of the current file, and not some default for all STL files.

Of course there would be people who want the STL, DXF, SVG, AMF, OFF, CSG,
image files in separate directories.

Perhaps combine this need with laird's request for IDE 'build' then you
could have export trigger a script or whatever to move your file to
wherever, and do whatever post-processing you want. Or wait for the talked
about script feature.

@Whosawhatsis, I presume that is MDI mode, if you turn that off each
instance is a separate process, so that shouldn't happen.

Or provide an ExportToSTL intrinsic which would accept a path.

So many ways to slice it

It forces an indent even if overridden. 
See video, I type enter, backspace, backspace, '}' (no tabs - that was
autoindent)

oops, it was putting it in the right place, but I think if it is overridden
it should not fight the typist.
