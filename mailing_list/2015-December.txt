I have made changes to the main section and rotate extrusion subsection:
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/2D_to_3D_Extrusion

And added a new subsection 
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/General_(by_c.t.chin)#Objects

For now I don't see merits in ChrisLT's complaints and proposals except his 
complaints about the doc is quite valid and I'm trying my best to improve
it.
It does not help that I also have to learn the underlying logics and
mechanisms 
before being able to write some non-garbage into the doc.

Particularly Chris' view of 2D and 3D being not a subset/superset relation
is a 
valid one.  So I want to get some authoritative position from the dev on 3D
polygons.  
(that's what I call a 2D shape that's been translate()'d or rotate()'d off
the X-Y plane.)
Are they an abomination that is liable to extermination without warning?  Or
are they 
there to prepare for a future feature of hull() accepting 3D polygons as
input?  

Or there's some deeply mystery behind the disparate behavior of Preview vs.
Render?

Passing a parameter to a module to make it do two completely different
things doesn't make sense from a programming point of view. It is better to
stop pretending it is a single thing and make two modules: wire_inner() and
wire_outer(). That is a lot more descriptive than wire(which=2) and
wire(which=-1) and since they can be single line modules it is actually
less code.

module wire_inner()cylinder(d = 1, h = 15, center = true);
module wire_outer()cylinder(d = 1.5, h = 7, center = true);


$fn=16;

difference() {
 cube([5, 5, 5], center = true);
 wire_outer(); // part A
};

wire_inner(); // part B

It is more readable but it still doesn't get around the fact you can't have
negative objects outside of a difference.

You could make a module that does both an add and a subtract but it makes
these code more obscure.

module add_and_subtract()
    union() {
       difference() {
           children(0);
           children(1);
       }
       children(2);
    }


$fn=16;
add_and_subtract() {
    cube([5, 5, 5], center = true);
    wire_outer();
    wire_inner();
}

And you could to a truly horrible hack like this: -

module wire()
   if($negative)
       wire_outer();
   else
       wire_inner();

module add_and_subtract()
    union() {
       difference() {
           children(0);
           $negative = true;
           children(1);
       }
       $negative = false;
       children(1);
    }

$fn=16;
add_and_subtract() {
    cube([5, 5, 5], center = true);
    wire();
}

But I think it is just obscuration.

I disagree with your comment that they are completely different things.
One encapsulates the other, 

You notice that the code can be single lines; but I have only presented the simplest form for discussion.



I found this reference, but I'm working through it.

  No you can't do that in one operation in OpenScad. You need to subtract the hole and add the rod. You could subtract a tube, which would leave a hole with a rod in it but it couldn't protrude out of the cube without adding it.

    I want the "cylindrical hole" to be in the same module as the "thinner rod".
    Wherever the "thinner rod" is placed, the "cylindrical hole" follows.

    If I build a union of all the "thinner rods", their companion holes are cut from some shape that I specify.

This is not a programming issue but a matter of organization.  Those are not 
two completely different things.  It makes perfect sense to throw several
highly 
related things (with inter-related dimensions, e.g.) into a module and pass 
sensible arguments to it to retrieve various part of that thing or variant 
incarnations of the same thing.

However I would not use numeric arguments.  Rather use strings:



You can even write a more elaborate if () ... else ... statements using
search() 
that would allow the calling routine to pass a vector of strings, so that
any 
number of parts can be retrieved by a single call e.g.

does this supersede  OpenSCAD version 2015.11.15 (git a7ee1f2) ?

I agree that some sort of more consistent version numbering be done. It is
confusing.

maybe something like:

3, 2, 20151130

we would have version 3.2, but a dev build done as of 20151130

so if we had another dev build off of 3.2 of say 20151215, then we would
all know that the devbuild on 20151215 would be later.

similarly, if there was a new branch of openscad of say 4.0

I think this release comes from the 2015.03 branch, and only contains
critical bug fixes, and not any new features that may have been added to
the master branch. So I don't think it supersedes 2015.11.15.

I would say yes, those bug fixes are also integrated into the master
branch. I can see that the RELEASE_NOTES file in the master branch has been
updated to list all of the bug fixes.

I don't know how to get that information out of github, however. I can see
the 'master' and '2015.03' branches in github, I can see the list of
commits to the 2015.03 branch, but I can't find a way to visualize the
synchronization of changes between these two branches.

Thanks, nop head, I didn't know about Graphs/Network.

It's not showing me what I want, though. In the Network diagram, I can see
two separate commits just before Nov 16, on the master and 2015.03
branches, both labelled "sync with 2015.03-2", but there is no arc
connecting these nodes. The two branches don't have any connecting arcs, as
far back as I looked.

I might be wrong but I think it means the change was done twice, once to
each branch, rather than done in one branch and merged into both. I am very
git illiterate myself and can barely use it.

To clarify:

o OpenSCAD releases: YYYY.MM. Every new release is expected to add new behavior, and perhaps change or deprecate behavior as well
o Bugfix releases: YYYY-MM-n. These are pure (critical) bugfixes with no new functionality added.
o Development snapshots: YYYY.MM.DD. These are unstable builds, then may contain new experimental functions, they may be severely bug ridden, but tend to be relatively stable.

Yes, we can change this. In the future. The proposed OpenSCAD2 major update could be a good time to do this.

..I forgot (as it felt needless to say): Yes, all bugfixes are in master. As all development happens in master, we simply cherry pick or backport critical issues to 2015.03-x when needed.

I don?t have a good way of ensuring a clean history.
My workflow is _usually_ to git cherry pick commits related to github issues from master into 2015.03.x.
Even though this would give us an equivalent patch, the git commit hash would be different.
I think that, in order to have a properly linked graph, we?d have to do development in the 2015.03 branch and merge _those_ changes into master. That?s a perfectly valid workflow, we just tend not to do it.

In the Network diagram, I can see two separate commits just before Nov 16, on the master and 2015.03 branches, both labelled "sync with 2015.03-2", but there is no arc connecting these nodes. The two branches don't have any connecting arcs, as far back as I looked.

I see!

In this case, I hope you can fix it soon. Until then I guess I need to
compile against Qt4 myself, right?

By the way, kintel, I think I might know you from Metalab :)

Thank you all for your help!

I would consider this a bug. It?s due to a cheap attempt at creating a 3x3 transformation matrix starting with a 4x4 one:
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/blob/master/src/GeometryEvaluator.cc#L566

I have no idea how many are depending on this bug, but we should consider deprecating this and leaving those few behind.

2D display should, ideally, stay 2D in the preview mode as well. That has been a source of confusion for a while.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Rotate relative, or make spokes
Message-ID: <565E4692.50500@gmail.com>

The issue here doesn't appear to be the rotation itself, but the 
position of the cubes. A cube is created with it's lower-left corner at 
the origin:



When this is rotated, the corner is rotated, and when you have several 
of them, it looks "twisted."

What you probably want is to center the cube on the X axis only. 
Currently, this must be done by manually translating the object by half 
that dimension. In addition, you're having it extend along the Y axis. 
To line it up with the circle polygon, it'll be easier if you extend it 
along the X axis.

To create the center polygon, you can use a cylinder with the $fn 
parameter to control the number of sides. All put together, you get 
something like this:



And here's the updated code, with comments, for your modification.

NoArm = 7; // The number of arms / sides of the polygon
ArmWide = 3; // The width (short side) of the arms
ArmHigh = 3; // The height (along the Z axis) of the arms
ArmLong = 80; // The radial length of the arms

ArmsOnEdges = true; // Should the arms intersect the edge or vertices of 
the polygon

CircRadius = 30; // The radius of the polygon

union()  // Union isn't strictly necessary because everything at the top 
level is implicitly unioned
{
     for (i=[1:NoArm])
             rotate([0,0,360/NoArm*i]) // Rotate the arm after it's centered
             translate([0,-ArmWide/2,0]) // Center the arm around the X axis
             cube([ArmLong, ArmWide, ArmHigh]); // Make the arm extend 
along the X axis

     rotate(ArmsOnEdges ? 180/NoArm : 0) // Rotate the polygon to it's 
side if so desired
         cylinder(h=ArmHigh, r=CircRadius, $fn=NoArm);  // The polygon, 
as a cylinder with a particular number of sides
}


Best,

~ Yona

(5th try sending this to the list)
Thanks, Marius. It was definitely z-fighting. It was easy to add a few
microns to the negative blocks because of the way I designed my code.
Worked like a charm. This is my first everOpenSCAD project so I'd like to
get some feedback on my approach to such a complex (10 sequences)
animation, and construction of the components. Please be gentle.

Looks like I am still getting filtered when I include URLs so I'm going to
just say same domain as the first time and...

You can use the argument

additional translation)

I was waiting and waiting for the -2 installer being a little jealous of
MacOS users who got their dmg already.  

Only today I was impatient enough to check http://files.openscad.org/ and
found that the Windows installers had been sitting there for over almost 2
weeks  Why does the download page fail to link to the latest release?

We upload to the server before announcing the release, so we have the chance to test last-minute issues.
I guess we forgot to push the new link to the website, sorry.

Hi,
I have several dozens implementations of the same module (some of them
work as expected, some of them do not). Those were provided by
students as part of they assignment. Now I'd like to check if someone
didn't just copy-pasted his friends code and changed the variable
names etc.

I was thinking if comparing CSG tree would do the trick. Would
comparing two CSG trees with diff work? Or do I need to load the tree
to some dictionary-like structure and compare those?

Also, is there a command line way to export CSG tree?

Thanks for your tips.

If I would do it, I would maybe write my own parser for the language and
them compare the AST (abstract syntactic tree) of each sample code.

On the other hand, you could encourage your students to share code and
improve upon the work of each other :-)

That's what would be great, but unfortunately very hard to evaluate :(

You can make the students use GitHub and then evaluate based on how
intensely they collaborate on the platform as opposed to simply evaluating
the final piece of code.

In other words... you can see the ongoing process of creating the solution,
instead of simply evaluating the correctness of the final script.

CSG output is basically a dump of the internal AST.

Exporting on command line is possible by specifying csg as file type.

openscad -o output.csg input.scad

An approach like this is highly dependend on the problem.

- How many students do you have? 
- How many different solutions will the problem have, if it is solved in a
straight way? How probable is it to find the same solution (i.e. just naming
differences allowed).
- How many different solutions are syntactically equivalent (e.g. ordering
of union-elements)
- How many different solutions are semantically equivalent (is problem
completely characterized?)

Up to 100 students: I'd recommend to just look at the codes for 10 minutes
(6 secs each). With this you could exctract suspicious solutions for closer
inspection, which would cost you another 20 minutes or so. 
Writing a "usable" software will cost you month! And how would you validate
it?

what you did please change this code at my eyes the following way..."

Actually, more than a few.

That's what I'm not sure.

It is.

I've tried that, but I simply cannot hold that much information in my
head. It's slightly less than 100.

> Writing a "usable" software will cost you month!
That's why I just try to use what's already available.

I would inspect the code manually, after I find similarities in the
CSG tree. Than I would get the students to explain to me why they did
this and that, and to change the module to act differently, etc.

Thanks for all the feedback.

One other thing I would suggest is to require each student to sign+watermark their work with text() calls and/or simple surface() image maps.

- guarantees every model is at least a little unique
- presents opportunities to include side-bar discussions on intellectual property matters such as copyrights, trademarks, creative commons licensing, etc.
- provides a little incentive to ?take ownership? of their models because it?s been personalized.

At a previous job, we used cpd, an open source copy & paste detector, to
find dodgy code where a developer had simply copied and pasted large blocks
of code, rather than using abstraction. So, not an educational use case.

But, you could use 'cpd *.scad' to find code duplicated between different
source files.

Here's a project similar to what I remember:
pmd.sourceforge.net/pmd-4.3.0/cpd.html

My 2 cents:

just give a new homework that expands on the concept of the last.

Do this 3 times.

After that, the students that did there homework can follow your classwork.

The ones that only copied thier(sp?) work will not understand and be bored.

They wont enroll in the next course and/or fail any exam.

Any rotation not around the z axis of a 2d-object should through an error.

The question is, is the code that does the rotation 'aware' that it is
acting on a 2d object?

My Prolog teacher in university managed to do this. She even detected solutions copied&renamed from earlier cohorts.
No idea how, but she did hold a PhD on some AI topic : /

Same thing happened at my university as well. And there was a "black
market" of older students selling the service of programming these
exercises for the younger students who were willing to pay for it. Pices
were around 30 dollars for each exercise. There were even people charging 3
dollars per grade. As grades went from 0 to 10, if your grade was 8, then
you would pay 24 dollars for the service.

People very often asked me if I could offer that kind of service but I
never did it, because I knew is was a corrupt/evil system.

There was even people developing tools to automactically generate code
variants that supposedly could not be detected by the anti-copy system! I
remember that my most frequent though was: "what a waste of educational
opportunities... These kids could be learning much more if they were
invited into engaging with some sort of collaborative development practice,
and corruption in such a collaborative system would be so much harder to
endure..."

This was approximately 10 years ago. Nowadays, it seems nothing really
changed much, unfortunately. :-(

A single module -- yes.

but the first child of the difference should not be specified in the child.

There are -lots- of tools for detecting academic plagiarism. If you want
something automatic, best to use a real tool. Here is a recent list of
reviewed tools.

Cpd is better, though, if you specifically want to compare program
structure while ignoring changes to variable names.

There's a huge issue of software freedom on all of the 5 "solutions"
suggested in this article. But even more damaging than that is the
generalized will to frame copying as a bad thing, by using terms like
"plagiarism" to refer to it.

Copying is a reality! It should be incorporated into the educational
framework, instead of banished as some sort of crime or blasphemy. Refusing
to acknowledge that copying happens and that it will continue to happen as
part of our daily digital modern lives, will only propagate (or even
further increase) the distancing of educational practices from the
realities of our modern world.

These kids should all be writing patches and making pull requests!

Well, I'm a University lecturer, and what you say is a breath of fresh air 
Felipe. It is said, "Copying from one person is plagiarism; copying from lots 
of people is research". I encourage copying when it promotes understanding (as 
in your scenario) but in a commoditized educational environment, 
establishments reach for metrics to prove they are getting their assessments 
right, and one of those is "similarity" (which is falsely taken to mean a lack 
of originality).

I had an excellent PhD student once who got accused of copying by an 
antiplagiarism program once. It turned out he was judged to have copied from a 
paper which had quoted one previously written himself while working at a 
different institution!

We have a research group drinking game now. Every time somebody is falsely 
accused of plagiarism, the rest of the group has to buy him or her a drink. 
Fortunately it's a small research group...

I'll shut up now because this doesn't really have much to do with OpenSCAD :)

I used to teach computer science. If student X spends many hours writing a
program and student Y then spends 4 minutes copying the program and
changing indentation and variable names, it's not fair to give X and Y the
same grade. If this copying is forbidden, then student Y has also violated
an honor code and demonstrated a lack of interest in fair play. Whenever
someone cheats in what ends up being a competition, it's necessary to
impose a penalty, otherwise everyone will feel compelled to cheat and the
school will become an institution for education in the art of cheating.

You could argue about whether school should be a competition or not, but as
an employer, I will not hire from schools where the students learn cheating
and copying rather than computer science or electrical engineering.
Students can choose whether they would rather go to schools which emphasize
copying or schools which emphasize learning and fairly demonstrated ability.

Message-ID: <19883DEB-F130-4F73-B9CE-65E862010189@schnitz.com>

This is my first attempt at a polyhedron. I hope I?m doing something obvious wrong, but I can?t figure out what that might be.

I have a cylinder and a polyhedron. If I remove the cylinder, the polyhedron renders. When the cylinder is present, I get the error:

ERROR: CGAL error in CGAL_Nef_polyhedron3(): CGAL ERROR: assertion violation! Expr: pe != 0 File: /Users/kintel/code/OpenSCAD/openscad-2015.03-2/../libraries/install/include/CGAL/Nef_3/polyhedron_3_to_nef_3.h Line: 212 

Originally, I had the cylinder and polyhedron overlapping, but I raised the cylinder for testing, with no change to the error. I?m running 2015.03-2.

bump_width = 2;

//snap-in pegs

peg_length = board_width-(bump_height/2);
peg_z = 52.5;

Three of the five faces are facing inwards instead of outwards. Use the
thrown together view to see them in purple and then reverse the order of
the points.

Plagarism is copying without credit. It's an important difference. The
smart arse student who throws together a large project by building 95% of
it out of other credited existing software and then spends the rest of the
week redesigning his pet arduino project is the one I want to be hiring 8)

I could go on a long rant about the output of a lot of universities but
it's drifting off topic. Suffice to say it's about time some of them were
taught "being good enough", "coming in on time and budget", "quality
metrics and testing models" and "two things frequently happen at once in
the real world"

And make sure when you get sued you can provide the source of the tool to
the students expert, and can justify the decision it made !

The tool just identifies suspicious pairings. Humans make decisions. Using
the tool to actually prosecute a case of plagiarism without applying
responsible human judgement would be irresponsible. In the student case,
you end up with something like 2 500 line programs with 8 subroutines with
the same number of parameters, non-whitespace lines of code, exactly
matching expressions, basic block structure and so on. At the undergraduate
student level, you are generally dealing with people who are cheating
because they don't know how to write computer programs. If they could do a
really good job of cheating, they wouldn't cheat. Catching bottom feeder
plagiarizers isn't rocket science, but it can be an n^2 problem for the
instructors, hence software to identify suspicious pairs.

Miro,
Here is the thing, when it goes to a class learning openScad or any C based
language. Reality of the matter is the following.
#1 Students will heavily lean on the examples especially if they are new.
#2 there is only a finite number of ways to accomplish the task given
#3 the outliers will be those people that have previous coding experience
not gained at the same university and same professors.
for example many of your students might have taken an intro into C++ with
the same professor and have no other previous coding experience so there
work will look the same
#4 but there will be that student or two that took that previous class just
for credit and they have massive self taught coding skills so their work
will look different.
#5 if you have some people in your class on a higher math level their work
will look different from the rest.
#6 but if you have 10 students in your class that took algebra in their
requirements with the same teacher their work will look the same too.
OpenScad is heavily algebra dependant

Any process that claims to be "educational" in my opinion is 
fundamentally based on transmitting values.  Certainly many aspects of 
knowledge can be judged as value free in their purest sense eg 
mathematics, but as soon as any application of that knowledge is made in 
our real world then somebody's values will intimately be entangled with 
that knowledge.  The choice of a particular mathematical formula, or in 
our present case, one algorithm over another alternative will have some 
sort of value judgment to be evaluated.  The discussions in this forum 
would be incredibly dull if there was not some sense of people's 
personal values being revealed at the same time.

Plagiarism is disliked because it is akin to identity fraud.  People 
passing themselves off as something they are not.  Deception is 
generally not highly valued in the work place (unless you are a used car 
salesman or a politician ( my own values and experience creeping 
here!!)) As a student chasing higher grades this may seem 
understandable, as many people do not value the process of education 
that much, just the 'rewards'. But to me as an employer, looking at a 
prospective employee drawing a salary for work completed, the reverse 
would be true, deception is not liked much (take the VW Diesel scandal 
for an example!!).

In a world swamped with "information sources", getting students to 
attribute their sources would be best practice.  As an educator spending 
enough time with students is the best way to know whether you are 
dealing with a impostor or not. However this means small class sizes and 
at least some customised individual projects for all students. This goes 
against educational bureaucracies always trying to minimise costs and 
mass production, however it allows the observant educator time to make 
more reliable assessments, and time to also pass on the values of 
honesty and integrity.

If students feel they are being processed by algorithms, then it must be 
tempting, and some degree understandable to write a better algorithm in 
return to beat the system.  This escalating technology battle is how 
education can ultimately become debased, but in fact the students are 
only returning the values they are being presented with ie "Don't worry 
about student contact hours, just come up with a better program to do 
the job...."

Not really. What I am suggesting is that before contemplating putting 
large amounts of effort into some involved technical solution it is 
worth exploring the values associated with the process.  Without wishing 
to be offensive, I am suggesting that deeper and deeper technical 
analysis of student's work by smarter and smarter algorithms will not 
necessarily produce better students.

In the case of analysing CFG trees to the nth degree to assist 
assessment I think it is waste of a good educator's  time?? So I am 
politely suggesting that setting the same project for many students for 
a significant part of their assessment where plagiarism is a significant 
threat, is just bad planning.

openSCAD is potentially a fantastic educational tool and the type of 
skills it encourages should be incorporated in all modern curricular.  
However when teaching these skills, if the challenges are not set up 
well for students, 3-D modeling could get a bad name because it will be 
perceived they are impossible to assess with regards to plagiarism.

I encourage to all educators to consider openSCAD, especially 
Mathematics and Technology teachers!! It is a fantastic resource.

'git cherry-pick -x' adds a cross reference and can help when using other
tools like github to analyze branches.

Hi, Welcome to the forum.

OpenSCAD is unitless.

When you translate it to some output device is where an assumption is made
what 1 is equal to.

Many 3D printers assume 1=1mm, but there are also plenty of designs in
inches, which means when you want to print them you need to scale it.

I'm a metric thinker, so I like to design assuming 1=1mm.

1inch=25.4mm (as I assume you know) so it is just a matter of scaling
up/down depending.

>From my exposure, most OpenSCAD designs assume 1mm.

I suppose it comes down to how hard it may be to convert your scripts,
and/or how your head hurts thinking in other units of measure.

For AMF export, the unit of measurement is 1 millimeter. That's hard coded.

There may be other cases of import or export where we support units of
measurement, but I'm not aware of them. I'm pretty sure that our STL, DXF
and SVG support is unitless.

I like that OpenSCAD is unitless.
User can easily scale output if they want a specific scale. E.g. at their 3D
printer stage.

However maybe its useful to add the constants for mmtoinch, etc... in case
someone wants to do that without looking it up.
In the same way many programs will add degreestoradians and radianstodegrees
as constants to be helpful to their users....?

mm_per_inch is already defined in <MCAD/constants.scad> and
<MCAD/math.scad>.
Also, math.scad defines deg(x) for converting x radians to degrees.

Surely this is just a case of adopting a convention and making it the case,
it should only impact exporters and importers.

If the community decided that the dimensional value 1.0 inside openscad
reffered to 1mm then all it needs is documentation to that effect.

Having it unitless only creates confusion, and opens the door for models to
be missinterpreted during exchange.

It would allow importers and exporters to work in real world units, for
example import dxf and export amf would work correctly and have the right
units

     translate([15,0,15])
         cube([10,10,0.00001]);

// if $fe<=0 or is undefined function returns the "standard" OpenSCAD
combination
//   of $fa & $fs [C code fragment: fmax(fmin(360.0 / fa, r*2*M_PI / fs),
5)]
// if $fn>0 it takes priority, fa() returns 360/max($fn,3)
function fa(r)=$fn>0?360/($fn>3?$fn:3):
               $fe>0?$fe<r?min(45,2*acos(1-$fe/r)):45:
               360/max(min(360/($fa>0.01?$fa:0.01),
                   2*PI*r/($fs>0.01?$fs:0.01)),5);

This now takes account of $fa & $fs and can be used to help code user
modules and functions that draw arcs:

// equivalent to circle(20);
CircleToo(20);

module CircleToo(r){
    n=ceil(360/fa(r)); // number of segments
    p=[for(i=[0:n-1]) let(a=i*360/n) [r*cos(a),r*sin(a)]];
    polygon(p);
}

Here the output of CircleToo() is modified by $fn, $fa & $fs in the same
manner that the built-in primitives are, however it is also modified by $fe
(see my 1st post):

$fe=0.05;
CircleToo(20);


Cheers,
Trygon

cylinder doesn't accept a vector argument, it is ignored, so you just get a
unit cylinder, the same as with cylinder();

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Best material for small animated gadget gears
Message-ID: <1516d395b99-3f28-5a7@webstg-m06.mail.aol.com>

Hi all.  I am designing an animated under-the-tree Christmas gizmo, and it needs a few smallish (1-4 inch diameter, 1/4 inch or so thick) working gears.

I am totally new to 3D printing, and just bought a TAZ-5 to make parts.

I've thoroughly researched the differences between ABS and PLA, but I'd still love some opinions.
My fear is that PLA might be too brittle to serve for gears, even though the load is very light.
Also, I guess its low softening point means that my gizmo could not be stored in a hot attic, right?

But ABS is supposed to be smellier and harder to work with, so that scares me a bit.

I've seen info on a new composite material sold (at higher price!) under the ColorFab brand name.
Has anyone worked with this?

Thanks for any opinions on my best choice for gear material!

Tim

That doesn't really work for a lot of applications. Consider a railway
model. It's drawn to full scale (about 21m long) taken from reference
drawings. It might be printed in a range of different model scales.

You might na?vely argue that the scale is then either "1:1 in mm" or
"whatever scale you wanted in mm" but actually its neither. The inputs to
the model consist of both elements scaled at 1:1 and elements scaled at
1:whatever because the wall thickness for example is dependant upon the
final result while the majority of the detail is based on the 1:1
dimensions.

Yes the final result might be at 1:1mm but the notion that its some kind
of generic unit throughout OpenSCAD just wouldn't work.

Other examples like screws have similar behaviour. You can elongate a
screw but generally the thread doesn't change dimensions. Often if you
make it bigger the same is true.

I would start with PLA, because it is so much easier to work with, and 
probably will do fine

Well, the PLA I use, melts at 212 C, so unless you live in AZ (funny, cause
I live there!), it should be just fine.
I mean it does get a little hot in the summer time - 118 or so for a while.
I don't think even in an attic it would be more than about 160 or so - even
in AZ.

As for brittle, it should be ok too, if you there isn't a lot of torque on
them. Just make them thick enough - say 5 mm or so.
I have made a set of gears for myself. And they worked well.

Yes, it melts at a relatively high temperature, but the glass
transition temperature is somewhere above 60?C which is easily
reached in direct sunlight, especially with black PLA. It will
not melt, but get very soft and deform.
I could observe that live with a black iPad stand which just
collapsed on a not even extremely hot day in summer :-).

ciao,
  Torsten.

well, true that.
I have plastic on my house, you know water pipes (above ground, of course),
and other plastic stuff like housing around air conditioning stuff.

It doesn't melt, but after 8 years it is pretty brownish looking (when the
house was new, it was off-white).
This, of course is due to the extreme UV, we have in AZ.

Heck, windshield wipers only last a year, here. And batteries? If you get 3
years from any battery (no matter how expensive), you are doing mighty
good. But that's AZ. One thing though, I don't have to shovel sunshine!

PLA has a glass transition at ~55C, so it will turn to rubber above that.

Great, thanks for the info.  I am looking at using sculpteo to print my
designs and it appears that their system assumes 1 = 1mm so I will just
create a function convert my dimensions to metric and generate one or two
pieces and then print a couple of different pieces just to test and make
sure everything comes out correct.  Then if all looks good on the test
pieces I will generate all the pieces and do a mass print.

What I have done in OpenSCAD and similar languages like Povray is this:

Inch = 25.4
Foot = (12 * Inch)
 and so on

It doesn't change anything, but you can then use the units that make sense,
as long as the software can deal with the scale.   In Povray I worked on a
huge animation project where none of the modelers could agree on what a
unit should be, so I made a define that had every linear unit I could think
of from Light_Year to Micron  Cubits, Furlongs, all were in there.

Sure, my entire printer didn't "melt" a couple years ago when I left it in
the car for an afternoon.  It just softened a bit...

http://i.imgur.com/nDbFRGu.jpg

The fact is PLA parts are a complete failure under any moderate heat.

I would make gears out of PETG, it has heat resistance comparable to ABS
with none of the warping/shrinking hell. Its really a dream to print with,
but it may require printing at a bit lower speed to get good results.  You
can find "Inland" or "eSun" brands of PETG on Amazon for roughly the same
cost as ABS or PLA filaments.

Also it has no odor and as far as I can tell the wear resistance is quite
good.

Yes the community, not just the OpenSCAD, but the larger 3D printing/rapid 
prototyping community, have decided and adopted a convention and
documentation 
to that effect: the programs and data files shall be unit-less.

If you can convince the world to change the STL definition to adopt a
physical 
unit, you are welcome to come back here to preach it for OpenSCAD.

I did not realize this question would cause such a stir.  I had played around
with AutoCAD years back and everything was done in either inches or
millimeters.  I figured the same was with OpenSCAD.  So another question to
go along with this is what are the Scale Markers on the X, Y and Z axis? 
Are they just units and not a millimeter or ???

Don't be apologetic, it's good to stir.  It's a perfectly valid question and
there's 
a perfectly valid answer.  Perhaps it should be added to the FAQ.  

AutoCAD is a different beast.  There are many many functionalities that are 
considered elementary by AutoCAD and most full featured CAD packages and 
even some free software.  But they are not found on OpenSCAD.  I did learn 
AutoCAD way way back then and over the years I have dabbled in a number of 
(even Pro/E) alternatives.  But I only stuck with a particular package for a
job 
or two or three.  None has the staying power for me to pick as a "career"
choice.  
One big reason is that they are too "heavy", full featured and powerful, but
it's 
a drain to keep myself, my students, PC and facility in a state to exploit
these full
packages.  OpenSCAD, being almost rudimentary, is perfect for myself and my 
lab.  A new student can read the whole manual (imperfect as it is) in an
afternoon 
and start making useful things in a few days.  

I don't always write OpenSCAD programs with mm as units.  My habit is to
design 
most things in 1:1 scale, say if I'm building 1:144 Millennium Falcon, I
would 
design it in OpenSCAD at 1:1 using meter as (implicit) unit and (perhaps) as
a 
final step scale(1/144) the whole thing.  Or much more likely, just leave it
at 1:1 
and only fix the scale at the slicing or printing step.  

Of course it doesn't always work like that, as Alan Cox wrote, there's a
minimum 
scale (wall thickness) and maximum scale (printable volume) so blanket
application 
of scale() doesn't work for more complicated designs.  Things like screws do
have 
an absolute size.  I have run into that problem as well, designing a
spaceship in 1:1
(with 0.001" thick metal foil) only to find out the elegant program code
must be 
messed up lots of exceptions and branching to deal with absolute scale of
the 3D 
printer.

You want recreate the shape faithfully?  Or you just want to make 
something with roughly the same size and reproduce it's functionality?

I would make an octagonal wave spring, pretty simple.  Looks 
like fun and useful...

I actually do need button battery cases, I only find one particular size 
at the local supply, which addressed my need for now, but it maybe 
worth having all sizes available.  Use copper tape for conductivity...

Hello

I have a bug with import  file Thingiverse.
If I take everything one file, everything is ok, and I can do a .stl

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n14954/bug3.jpg> 
code :
module woman (){
    import ("sunbathingnude.STL");
             
        }
        
    scale([7,7,7]) woman ();

        rotate ([-60,0,0])
       cylinder  (d=23,h=100,$fn=100);

This is not code or file because if I add something even without touching
the import file I have this error.
I tried with a dozen files thingverse and I still have the same error line
326

Thanks for your help

Hi. You may try to repair the .stl file first, with meshlab or acessing

OpenSCAD has a sparsely documented nude-detector.
It does not allow nudes to be rendered.

I'm sorry.

The problem is not repair the stl file , because the .stl only is correct ,
no problem
but when i make other objet with the .stl cube or cylinder or other , i have
this error.

No, it's not. If there is only the STL and nothing else, there is
no need for actual processing, hence no issue.

Only by combining with other things, the processing has to be done.

Also have a look at the FAQ:

I do not know if I understood OpenSCAD does not accept nude?

but with 90% of import STL files I have this error.
nude or otherwise, here it was just an example

thank you for your replies

yes i understand what you mean
but the problem is that the only stl file works very well, I can do F6
So it is good and fixed
but if I add a line or two of code into OpenSCAD, to a far away from the
cylinder stl file, I get an error when I do not change the file stl

sorry my English is too bad for me to express myself clearly

Netfabb isn?t able to repair such things. Use a more complete tool like Meshlab.

This one will F5 in a few seconds, but it's been 2.5 hours waiting for 
F6 to complete.  I know that it will, because I did it once before.

How would you speed it up?

Jon


$fn = 100;
rch = 0.1;
height = 200; // 30;
diam = 35;

module HoleCylinder()
     cylinder(h = 100, d = diam/10);

difference() {
     // outer
     cylinder(h = height, d = diam);
     // inner
     translate([0, 0, -1])
         cylinder(h = height + 2, d = diam - 4);
     // reduce the bottom end
     translate([0, 0, -1])
         cylinder(h = 10 + 1, d = diam - 2 + rch);
     // reduce the top end
     translate([0, 0, height - 10])

I would try: make a short cylinder with only one ring of holes, stick this
cylinder in a render(), and add as many of them together as you need.
I would also make the cylinder that punshes the holes as short as possible,
so they will not overlapp.

Consider whether you *really* need $fn=100 for all those HoleCylinder() elements. That?s where the bulk of the number-crunching is happening.

There was a discussion some time back: the cutting of a gem did take very
long.
Cutting the individual faces of the gem lead to a lot of overlapping
differences() close to the origin.
Maybe something similar is happening here.
re-odering the differences() lead to faster render times.

height = 30; // 30;
diam = 35;

module HoleCylinder()
//    translate([0,0,diam/2-4])#cylinder(h = 8, d = diam/10);
    cylinder(h = 100, d = diam/10);

Setting height=30, it takes 1min 22sec to render with the long cylinder.

It takes only 0min 40sec to render with the shorter cylinders.

If I make the cylinder into a module(), then I would not need the 
render() would I, except to speed up the F5, which is already quite fast

Hi,
Avoid 'minkowski' transformations. If a 'minkowsky' is not avoidable do it
in 2D and then extrude.
The 'hull' transformation can be very slow also.
If you have a composite object and you need view fluidity you may render the
modules that are completed an tested, starting those modules like this:

module foo() render convexity=x // x usually =2
{
 code
}

However since cache saving in not an option in OpenSCAD yet, when initiating
a new editing session you will have to painfully wait  until all modules are
rendered again. 
Good luck.

Also if there are sub-parts that are repeatedly used (and stable with fixed
sizes) you can export them as STL files, and import the STL, thus the
geometry of the parts does not need to be calculated every time.

...and don't use high $fn etc values for initial development.
Increase it when you are close to finished.
As sometimes different $fn can cause problems with some designs, you may
need a little further debugging on occasion. (mainly changes to how
cylinders/sphere join)

I agree with clothbot, $fn=100 appears a little excessive!

I have generally stopped using $fn, $fs & $fa since it can be hard to
determine sensible values to use and falling back to a large value for $fn
is tempting and works but is slow. I use $fe (see
http://forum.openscad.org/fe-Tolerance-based-arc-approximation-tp14212p14933.html)
and would code as below.

Cheers,
Trygon


$fn = undef;
$fs=0.01; // very small => $fa used

$fe=0.1; // 0.1/4 for final output?

rch = 0.1;
height = 200; // 30;
diam = 35;

function fa(r)=$fn>0?360/($fn>3?$fn:3):
               $fe>0?$fe<r?min(45,2*acos(1-$fe/r)):45:
               360/max(min(360/($fa>0.01?$fa:0.01),
                   2*PI*r/($fs>0.01?$fs:0.01)),5); 

module HoleCylinder()
     cylinder(h = 100, d = diam/10, $fa=fa(diam/20));

difference() {
     // outer
     cylinder(h = height, d = diam, $fa=fa(diam/2));
     // inner
     translate([0, 0, -1])
         cylinder(h = height + 2, d = diam - 4, $fa=fa((diam-4)/2));
     // reduce the bottom end
     translate([0, 0, -1])
         cylinder(h = 10 + 1, d = diam - 2 + rch, $fa=fa((diam-2+rch)/2));
     // reduce the top end
     translate([0, 0, height - 10])
         difference() {
             cylinder(h = 10 + 1, d = diam + 1, $fa=fa((diam+1)/2));
             cylinder(h = 10 + 1, d = diam - 2 - rch,

Hi Michael

Here is the file. https://www.dropbox.com/s/umqyfgg2wv63bq3/cp.dat?dl=0

I am also getting the same error with the other .dat's in the project.

Your code renders in  2 hours, 4 minutes, 48 seconds on my machine.


With the shorter cylinders, that dont overlap at the origion it is faster:
//    translate([0,0,diam/2-4])#cylinder(h = 8, d = diam/10);

It renders in 0 hours, 42 minutes, 29 seconds

Sorry, I forgot the 'render' round brackets.

module foo() render(convexity=x) // x usually 2 
{ 
 code 
}

Subject: [OpenSCAD] How to check if a file exist? Why not export() from code?
Message-ID: <1449424960359-14982.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi,

Is it possible to check from the code if a .stl or other files exist ?
Another question: 
Since we may render an object from inside a module, why is not possible or
is difficult to have an export() functionality from code? Maybe export()
would be possible only outside a module? 

Actually it is possible to have:

module ABC() {
  import("ABC.stl");
}
 ABC();

However from the questions above, if solved, I would imagine something like
this: 

module ABC() export(ABC_flg,ABC.stl) render(){
  ABC_flg=true;
  if file ABC.stl exist then 
     ABC_flg=false;
     import("ABC.stl");
  else 
     ABC code;
   }
}

or in alternative:

module ABC() render(){
  ABC_flg=true;
  if file ABC.stl exist then 
     ABC_flg=false;
     import("ABC.stl");
  else 
     ABC code;
   }
}

export(ABC_flg,ABC.stl);
or even:
export(ABC_flg,ABC.stl, DEF_flg, DEF.stl, GHI_flg, GHI.stl etc...);

These would be great constructs to easily achieve fluidity.
I'm not an expert, please have mercy :)
 
Thanks.

Well some error has slithered into later releases...

I get the same error, but not in 2013.06, I'll try some other versions and
see if I can drill down to the root cause.

Peter,

I assume that your comment, "Your code renders in  2 hours, 4 minutes, 48
seconds on my machine.", was not with regard to the modified code I
provided?  The modified code with $fe=0.1 renders in 6 minutes, 21 seconds
on my PC.

The file management features you want belong in a scripting language, not
in OpenSCAD.

You can write a script in an existing scripting language like bash, or
perl, or python, which invokes OpenSCAD as a command each time it needs to
convert a model to a single STL file: use the -o option. That's how this
sort of thing is usually done. You can also communicate information from
the script into OpenSCAD (like, whether it should import a partiular file)
by setting OpenSCAD variables like ABC_flg, using the -D option.

$fn=100 is a large round number, so it sounds like Jon may have done what a
lot of us do, which is just pick a random number that is obviously big
enough.

The advantage of Trygon's $fe technique is that it's easy to be more
precise than "pick a large random number". $fe=0.1 means render to a
precision of 100 microns, which is good enough for most 3D printing jobs. A
lot of consumer grade 3D printers don't support layer heights less than 100
microns. Since you know how precise you want your 3D print job to be, it's
not hard to pick a value for $fe that is small enough, without being
excessively small. Too much precision slows rendering down too much.

Windows binaries are at October, Mac is at December.

Can we get some new binaries pls.

Hi Doug thanks for the reply.

However not all the guys who want to make composite objects using OpenSCAD
are programmers. I'm not, and I think many of us aren't also. The objective
is to have results faster. As I pointed out  "These would be great
constructs to easily achieve fluidity."
In this way we could achieve view fluidity on "real time" as the composite
object in construction progresses.
I think that the objective of openSCAD is to help make real and useful
things fast, for the mathematicians and theoreticals there are really an
abundant number of languages where they can express themselves.

Regards
jpmendes

Sorry, I just realised that I had the triangles inverted (points
anticlockwise rather than clockwise).  I have corrected the original post.

Thanks,

Something went wrong with the initial posting.

The question was what can be done to speed up the rendering. Are there
programming rules for that?

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n14997/Bell_2.jpg> 

This is the object that I want to make: the upper side of the bell of a bass
clarinet. 
What I do is draw the complete outside bell en substract the complete inside
bell using the difference function. I found out that difference is a lot
slower than union which I use in the test phase. 

The bell I first have made as 150 cylinders with a specific diameter. Each
one rotated around a certian angel. But hat did not give a good result. 
Now i make a 150 cylinder composed of a hull of very thin rotated cylinders. 

I am afraid the difference and the hull function makes it slow. 

Any idea for another way to draw this?

Hi,

What if something like this:


Sides = 100;
DefaultSides=24;
Height = 200; // 30; 
Diam = 35; 
Thick=6;


module Tube(Length,Dout,Din,Sides) //render(convexity=2) 
{			
    NSides= (Sides < 3 || Sides==undef)  ?  DefaultSides : Sides;

    rotate_extrude(convexity=2, $fn=NSides) translate([Din/2,0,0]) 
        square([(Dout-Din)/2,Length]); 
}
//Tube();

module HoleCylinder()  render(convexity=2) 
{   
   Din=Diam;
   Dout=Diam+Thick;

     difference() {
       Tube(Height,Dout,Din,Sides);
          for (i = [15:6:Height-15]) {
	    for (j=[0:360/20]) {
	       rotate([j*20, 90, 0])  translate([-i,0, 10]) cylinder(r=2,h=16);   
	   }
       }
   }
}
HoleCylinder();


In my dual core running Windows7 32bit it renders in less than 2 minutes. 
The part of the module missing is not significant in terms of speed.

Regards
jpmendes

Using import of stl is a very good idea.
It works for $fn=40 and results is a fast object.

Actually, no.  I just grabbed the number out of the air.  Everyone else 
is right: I could have used $fn=5 easily enough.  I just wanted it to be 
pretty!

I usually start at $fn=8 for octagonal coverage and work up from there as needed.

For the forum. looks like this:
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n15005/bondy-OpenSCAD.png> 
The difference between the two left most ones is in the module
HoleCylinder()
```
$fn = undef;
$fs=0.01; // very small => $fa used

$fe=0.1; // 0.1/4 for final output?

rch = 0.1;
height = 200; // 30;
diam = 35;

function fa(r)=$fn>0?360/($fn>3?$fn:3):
				$fe>0?$fe<r?min(45,2*acos(1-$fe/r)):45:
				360/max(min(360/($fa>0.01?$fa:0.01),
					2*PI*r/($fs>0.01?$fs:0.01)),5);

module HoleCylinder()
	cylinder(h = 100, d = diam/10, $fa=fa(diam/20)); // intersecting
	 // translate([0,0,diam/2-4])  // non-intersecting
		// cylinder(h = 8, d = diam/10);

difference() {
	// outer
	cylinder(h = height, d = diam, $fa=fa(diam/2));
	// inner
	translate([0, 0, -1])
		cylinder(h = height + 2, d = diam - 4, $fa=fa((diam-4)/2));
	// reduce the bottom end
	translate([0, 0, -1])
		cylinder(h = 10 + 1, d = diam - 2 + rch, $fa=fa((diam-2+rch)/2));
	// reduce the top end
	translate([0, 0, height - 10])
		difference() {

There are technical issues which prevent us from implementing the specific
feature you have designed. Your problem will need to be solved in some
other way.

What are problem are you trying to solve, at the higher level? What do you
mean by a "composite object"?

So far, I only have the impression that you want to build several different
geometric objects, and export each to a different STL file. That can be
done using a separate SCAD file for each object. If the problem is to share
common code between the separate SCAD files, then that can be done using
the 'include' or 'use' statements. But you also want to test if a specific
STL file exists, and I'm not sure why.

The existing documentation for using the openscad command line interface
from a scripting language is here. I'll admit that it isn't very user
friendly right now, and probably doesn't address your specific use case.

The stepsize for each ring is called Delta in your calyx module.
If you change this to 5 you will see more clearly that the hull() is not
working quite right.
Each step is not the same as the Delta+1 step.
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n15007/bell-hull.png> 

Mnay ways to refactor but possibly you could refactoring so that you pass in
the thickness of the wall as an arg to the module and calculate the next
ring(for the hull) on basis of +1 to Delta.

So calculation is simple for the inner and outer shapes for the difference.

Well, have a look at the sweep renderer shown in 
   http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:900137
Instead of feeding in a NACA profile, you'd just create a circle (or any
other 2D-shape). Building on the scheme shown in example2() the code is as
fast as it can get in OpenSCAD (especially for CGAL)

You also might be interested to use an interpolation scheme, which makes the
path calculation for your thing very convenient
  http://forum.openscad.org/general-extrusion-imperfect-tp14740p14758.html
respectively 
  http://forum.openscad.org/general-extrusion-imperfect-tp14740p14758.html

I've ported the nSpline library, but yet did'nt have time to connect it with
my sweep renderer in OpenSCAD and to publish it.

Hans - Thank you for the heads-up on PETG!  It looks fantastic, the very
material I'm looking for.  I wonder why only PLA and ABS are discussed.  I
never heard of PETG or saw it mentioned anywhere until your post.

Any idea what the glass transition temperature is?  I could not find that in

Thanks!

Hi Doug,

A composite object is to me a multi part object. I'm not English native
speaking, sorry. 
If there are technical issues ok no problem.

Why do I would need to check if a file (.stl) exist? Because if true it
would be simply imported if false the code would be compiled rendered and
exported, and all would be automatic. Need to change a module? Simply delete
the .stl file with the same name or change the export() flag.
    
I know it can actually be done in a non automatic way with some additional
effort. 

OpenSCAD lacks measurement facilities. So it is very important to me to see,
pan and rotate a multi part object with fluidity as it is being built.
   
Thanks anyway.
jpmendes

If you use render() around each object you will get the almost effect you
want because the geometry is calculated and then cached. From then on it
renders instantaneously. It only gets recalculated if something it depends
on changes. The only downside is once you quit openscad the cache is lost,
so it takes time to start again from scratch. An advantage is it
automatically keeps track of dependences. Under your scheme you would have
to remember to delete the stl files when anything that affected them
changed.

I know that. However imagine a 30 different part object! Every time you start
a session you loose 2 or more hours just to see the assembled object? 
Obviously I can render each module save it as an STL file. Then I can be
editing a sub-part  in one OpenSCAD instance and have another instance of
OpenSCAD opened consisting mainly of a list of imports, rotations and
translations, just to see, place and adjust the position of the parts in the
assembled set. It is possible yes but not practical from my point of view. 

Maybe this should be the right way. The professional designer/builder have
to obey to more strict rules  and procedures than an occasional
designer/builder like me. 

Thanks guys 
jpmendes

I am wanting to generate blocks of various shapes and sizes with holes

shapes, sizes and hole location in a json file.  Is there any way to use
this in OpenSCAD so I don't have to have a separate file for each shape /

I changed the delta into a variable one:

/module calyx(buiten)
{
    delta = 2;
    delta2 = delta/2;
    delta3 = delta2/2;
    delta4 = delta3/2;
    for (height = [0:delta:maxheight-4*delta])
    {
        calyx_segment(height, delta, buiten);
    }
    for (height = [maxheight-4*delta:delta2:maxheight-4*delta2])
    {
        calyx_segment(height, delta2, buiten);
    }
    for (height = [maxheight-4*delta2:delta3:maxheight-4*delta3])
    {
        calyx_segment(height, delta3, buiten);
    }
    for (height = [maxheight-4*delta3:delta4:maxheight-delta4])
    {
        calyx_segment(height, delta4, buiten);
    }
 }/

And also corrected the culculations for the thickness. It is a dy/dx of a
power to 4: (y = B -x^4*A)

I have a design with over 400 objects of over 100 types. I renders in about
20 minutes when first loaded. Perhaps yours are more complex.

It would be easy to import json in Python and spit out openscad, if you
speak Python that is.

@ parkinbot: Interesting this sweep function. And it is indeed fast.
But it's a little to complicate for a beginner like me to implement now.

@neon22. The delta error is corrected nog. This is the result at this
moment.
Rendering the inside and the outside with $fn= 100 took about 20 minutes.

ah, right. I guess if I just make a library with the various drawing
functions and then I can then generate a separate scad file for each shape /
size combination that just uses my library.

Depending on the actual objects, you could also have a look at
BOLTS and see how it's done there. Or maybe even integrate :-).

Dear jpmendes,

I had a look at your code: The cylinders that you subtract are overlapping
by a little bit.

Now I realise this is not so importend in this case, decreasing fn makes it
run fast enough.

This line

               rotate([j*20, 90, 0])  translate([-i,0, 10])
cylinder(r=2,h=16);

I changed to

               rotate([j*20, 90, 0])  translate([-i,0, 15])
cylinder(r=2,h=16);

to remove the overlap.

This makes it 20 % faster in F5, preview and F6, render.

Here are the numbers:

F5, with overlap of the subtracted cylinders:  1 minutes 38 seconds

F5, no overlap: 1 minutes, 23 seconds,  gain in speed 20%

F6, no overlap: 1 minutes, 23 seconds,  gain in speed 20%

F6, with overlap: 1 minutes, 36 seconds

For anyone who likes the end result.
I generate the file twice and then substract them in an other scad file.
It is also in this file but takes too long to render (even F5).

With the code as-is I get a nice horn shape.
E.g. set $fn to 12 on first line for faster results.

But I get a bad object if I change "buiten=true" over in the difference loop
and get the other surface.
I.e.
difference()  {
	translate([0,0,-150]) calyx(buiten=true); 
	// translate([0,0,-150]) calyx(buiten=false); 
}
The nice bell shape is gone. I've tracked it to the first region in calcyx:
for (height = [0:delta:maxheight-4*delta])
		calyx_segment(height, delta, buiten,0);
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n15026/bell-2.png> 

But I can't see the bug.
(For me, at low $fn the difference goes pretty fast, and only 20 sec for
$fn=100.
but the resulting object is super slow in camera due to large number of
surfaces.
The Render() takes a very long time (48sec for $fn=12)  even for single
surface.)

This will fix the bug:

                        (d_btm_inside+d_btm_wall - d_inside): 
                        d_top_wall)/2;
        d_wall2     = ((d_inside2 + d_top_wall) < (d_btm_inside+d_btm_wall)
? 
                        (d_btm_inside+d_btm_wall - d_inside2): 
                        d_top_wall)/2;

Found it - it was this:
dx1    = d_wall * sin(rc);
dx2    = d_wall2 * sin(rc2);
dy1    = d_wall * cos(rc);
dy2    = d_wall2 * cos(rc2);
They were d_wall and not d_wall2

I actually solved this issue for my own projects using 'make'. But,
since you said you aren't a programmer I wasn't going to mention it.

I often do multi-part projects, sometimes in separate files.

The make programming tool was designed for exactly this problem. But,
it's yet another thing to learn.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Stuck in Thrown Together view
Message-ID: <1449597408892-15032.post@n5.nabble.com>

I was rendering a model and it was taking forever so I closed the OpenSCAN
process and reopened it and now I get this message when I open any model and
it will not get out of Thrown Together view.  I have uninstalled it and
reinstalled it and nothing has changed.  I am running version 2015.03-1. Any
ideas?  I am kind of at a stand still until I can get this working again.


Warning: Missing OpenGL capabilities for OpenCSG - OpenCSG has been
disabled.

It is highly recommended to use OpenSCAD on a system with OpenGL 2.0 or
later.
Your renderer information is as follows:
GLEW version 1.12.0
 ()
OpenGL version 


Also if I try to render the model I get the message:

This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual
way.  Please contact the application's support team for more information.

The 'make' approach is not very user friendly, or easy to use. Sure,
developers can figure it out, but even developers have IDEs nowadays.

If I was designing a user friendly alternative to the 'make dependency'
feature of OpenSCAD, I'd consider something like a variant of the render()
operation, with a filename specified. OpenSCAD would cache the rendered
node in the file system as an STL file, and write out a deps file with the
same base name. The deps would be used to determine if the STL file is out
of date, the first time it is referenced during a session.

Even simpler would be for OpenScad to just save its cache in a file and
read it next time the same OpenScad file was opened. That would be entirely
backwards compatible.

Yes saving the cache file is something I had been meaning to ask about. 
Right now my current project takes 8 minutes to render.

Yes are very right, that was also wrong.


Another thing is that I see small white dots in the object. I thougth that
everything is done to make it watertight. Also when I import all SLT files
sometime a large hole appears in the object depending on the angle that the
object is viewed. Is it in bug in OpenScad or in my design?

Have you set the convexity parameter to import?

design\\basklarinetbocht_v2.stl", convexity = 5);

?

A strange problem. 
F5 gives a good result (see first image).
F6 seems to forget the main part of the object.

This is my code:
/
difference()
{
    union()
    {
        difference()
        {
           import("C:\\Users\\Eigenaar\\Documents\\Mijn 3D
design\\basklarinetbeker buiten v4.stl", convexity = 5);
           import("C:\\Users\\Eigenaar\\Documents\\Mijn 3D
design\\basklarinetbeker binnen v4.stl", convexity = 5);
           
        }
        translate([0,0,-155]) 
        {
            cylinder(5,(d_btm_inside +d_btm_wall/2)/2, (d_btm_inside
+d_btm_wall/2)/2);
        }
    }
    translate([0,0,-160]) cylinder(11,d_btm_inside/2, d_btm_inside/2);
}/

F5 result:

When I change convexity into 6 (don't now why, just trying something.

Odd because AFAIK convexity is only used by OpenCSG and F5. It should not
affect F6.

I tried to see if the two imported files need repair.
Meshlab detects some holes and other things, but I can't find and fix them.

The four sections overlap pretty well with the parameter values you are using
but it begins to fail as:
 -  rotatie increases - wall gets thin in upper bell region, 
 -  as height increases,
 - as mildfactor increases.
However I don't think the white dots are symptons of this. They look like a
display artifact.

 - I can't simulate the gaping hole you're seeing in the side. Not sure
what's causing that.
 - The base of the inner horn doe snot penetrate the outer horn's shae so
there is no hole in the base of my models.
 - The model I exported as STL had nothing wrong with its mesh. So maybe
your parameter space needs tweaking ?

Not sure but the error suggests you're running on a system with very old
OpenGL drivers.
Do you have a newer system, or can you update your drivers ?
The mailist wil not see your email until you register.

It is a new computer, OpenSCAD had been working just fine for a couple of
weeks.  Things just went haywire when I killed the process during a render.

I installed GLView and ran the test with it and it worked just fine with
OpenGL 1.1 - 1.5 and 2.0

Could you paste the contents of Help->Library Info ?

Also, please make sure you use the latest version of OpenSCAD; 2015.03-2 - just so we eliminate any bugs fixes since the previous release.

The dots tend to indicate two vertices close to each other, I think it is a
similar artefact to z-fighting. If they go away on render don 't worry to
much, but I do try to eliminate them by moving a face a smidgeon one way...

Re the hole, if higher convexity doesn't work, try
Edit/Preferences/Advanced/Force_Goldfeather, if that fixes it, it points to
your graphics drivers, try updating. (I always struggle not to type it as
Goldfinger... :)

BTW unless you color()'ed it, that purple is a sign that your faces are

Thanks Neon22 for checking.
The white dots dissappeared when i made the thickness of the cylinders that
enclose each hull minimal (d = 0.001). In fact each cylinder on top of each
pie coincide with the bottom one of the next pie.

But because of other problems (error checking in meshLab) i decided to
increased the space parameter by increasing the thickness.

Hi Kintel,

Thanks for that. It help a lot,. Not I am half way:

One part of the imports is giving an error:

Also an attempt with nettfab did not work.
But that tool is completely new to me, maybe I don't use it in the right
way.

I see some coloured parts on the object. It that a problem? What to do with
that?

Hi!

I wonder if this post is still active and I can post here. I recently
switched to a new computer with a Intel HD graphics 5500 graphic card and
the preview is not working, i.e. I can only see bits and pieces of the
drawing.

I also tried with the snapshot that were posted here but neither the 32 nor
the 64 bit are working,

it's a dell laptop with an Intel core i7-5500CPU @ 2.4GHz,

do you guys have any advice, things to try?

thanks 
Andrea

Hi Andrea,

Could you try this:
1) First, make sure your run the latest version of OpenSCAD: 2015.03-2
2) Make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphic card
3) Activate this and see if that helps: Preferences->Advanced->Force Goldfeather 
4) If all fails, send us the contents of Help->Library Info

Looks like the object imported OK now, which is good.
I don?t know what the next problem is - this is an internal error thrown from a 3rd party library.
We could investigate it if you share your files.

Even better: If you could modify the STL files into the smallest possible files still exhibiting this behavior, that would greatly increase the changes for someone looking at it, as such debugging is very time consuming.

Thanks. This not only says OpenGL 1.1, but it say it couldn?t find any graphics cards and uses Microsoft?s software renderer, which is no good.

Could you post the corresponding output from GLView?

Not sure what else I would recommend right now. Are all other applications working well? Have you tried reinstalling the graphics drivers, in case your system has gotten confused? Reinstalling OpenSCAD?
It sounds a bit like a light case of system corruption to me.

So windows installed some updates last night and restarted my computer and
everything seems to be working fine now.  This make no sense to me but at
least it is working.  I will let you know if it occurs again.

I ran into the same issue again.  Here is what I was doing when this
happened.

I was working on a library of drawing functions in one file and a test file
that tests one drawing function at a time.  Once I had my library changes
done and working I opened a real file that use a lot of functions of the
drawing library and then OpenSCAD crashed and now I can't get it to even
display my test file.  Now when I click Help -> Library Info it crashes
OpenSCAD.

I rebooted my computer and the same thing happens.

Hello Kintel,

The files can be found here:
http://sax.jonker.co/techniek/288-ontwerpen-van-de-beker-van-een-bas-klarinet.html

I change fn to 10 and then increased it until the problem occured.
When fn was 60 the problem occured.
I am sorry these files are 6M bytes.

The first file is the Openscad file producing the outside en inside of the
bell. 
The last file is the one I use to substract them.

The error I now get is:
ERROR: CGAL error in CGAL_Nef_polyhedron3(): CGAL ERROR: assertion
violation! Expr: pe_prev->is_border() ||
!internal::Plane_constructor::get_plane(pe_prev->facet(),pe_prev->facet()->plane()).is_degenerate()
File:
/data/OpenSCAD/libraries-mingw64-master/mxe-w64/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static/include/CGAL/Nef_3/polyhedron_3_to_nef_3.h
Line: 293  

thanks 

Johan

Another thing:

I tried Meshlab.
and used the filter Remove T-vertices by Edge Collapse.
That did not help.

I also tried filteringe the STL- files in Meshlab with the Remove T-vertices
etc.
That worked in that way that the error message changes into this:

I got a 404 on the first file.
Are you saying that the STL files are modelled and exported from OpenSCAD as well?

Ouch, that doesn?t sound good.
To check if this could be a problem with a 3rd party library we?re using, it would be helpful if you?d be willing to test the previous few versions of OpenSCAD on your computer and see if you get any different behavior.
Testing both 32-bit and 64-bit version might also reveal some differences.

Here are links to the previous releases of OpenSCAD:

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Using bevel library / what is a connector?
Message-ID: <1449714488982-15076.post@n5.nabble.com>

Can anyone help me understand this pls? Still a noob, so I'm making no
headway with the "instructions"...

I'm trying to do an indent ala: 
https://www.tinkercad.com/things/0Bsnpi3wsOY-copy-of-tray-for-penny-press-board-game-stacks-of-stories

I thought I might be able to do it with the bevel library that I found:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:30336

But I have no idea what a coordinate is or how it fits in / is used here...
It seems to be an array of arrays. The comments from the library are at the
bottom of the code.
 
Code is copied and pasted from one of the examples and I've tried to change
it to suit... 

Code:

use <obiscad/bevel.scad>
use <obiscad/attach.scad>

//-- Parts parameters
th = 3;
bsize = 1;
size = [bsize,60,th];
rad=10;

//-- The two ortogonal parts
translate([rad*2,0,0])
  cube(size,center=true);

cylinder(th,rad,rad, $fn=100, center=true);

//-- Define the connectors
ec = [ [0,rad,0], [0,0,0], 0];
en = [ [0,rad,0], [rad*2+bsize/2,rad,0],  0];

//-- Debuging
*connector(ec3);
*connector(en3);


//-- 1 bigger rounded buttress
bconcave_corner_attach(ec,en,th,cr=8,cres=100, l=th);

//[crn, ?, ?]

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//-- API MODULE
//--
//--  Attach a Beveled concave corner
//--  Two connectors are needed:
//--    * edge_c   : Connector located on the edge, paralell to the edge
//--    * normal_c : Connector located on the same point than edge_c 
//--                 pointing to the internal corner part, in the direction
//--                 of the corner bisector
//--    * cr        : Corner radius
//--    * cres      : Corner resolution
//--    * l         : Corner length

The STL files are fine. no problem with them.
This suggests the load is causng a problem.
E.g. There are many very small step-like ridges around the flare of the
bell.
Its probable that the decimal points are being truncated and the vertices
that are very close together are not staying unique.

@ Kintel

Oh I am sorry, a type in the filename. It is modified now.
Because rendering became too slow i modelled the outside and inside in
OpenSCAD and used the difference function of the import of them in a
separate OpenSCAD file.

@neon,

That is interesting. What tool do you use to visualize that?

The only reason can be the thickness of the cylinders I use for the top and
bottom of the segments of the bell. I changed it into a very small value. In
MeshLab that looks better, but I can't see it as clear as in your picture.


module cylinder_pie(angle1, angle2, dx1,dx2,dy1,dy2,r1,r2,top,dr)
    {
           // draw top and bottom cylinders
           // rotate the cylinder
           // hull the cylinders
           // trick: draw an extra thick and large cylinder when the top is
reached and 
           d=0.00001;
           hull()
           {
                 
                 translate([ 0,dx1,dy1])
                 rotate( angle1, ([1,0,0]))
                 translate([0,0,-d])
                 cylinder(d,r1, r1, center=false);
                 echo("top:", dx1,dy1,angle1,d,r1);
               
                 translate([ 0,dx2,dy2])
                 rotate( angle2, ([1,0,0]))
                 translate([0,0,d])  
                 cylinder(d+top,r2, r2, center=false);
                 echo("bottom:", dx2,dy2,angle2,d+top,r2);

This is the result now: a lot of non-manifold edges detected in MeshLab.
Later this day I will see how to fix that. Suggestions are welcome (I am new
to Meshlab).

OK problem appears to definately be caused by the way you're hulling.
What's happening is the very small slices (0.01 or smaller) are creating
artifacts.
Ideally you should be able to use a value of 0.1 (say) for thickness and not
see much visual difference.

The trick to make this happen is to step through the loop in a different
way.
You want the parameterization to be by looping through i, i+1 and hulling
between them.
- where "i" creates each step in the curve. This way the hull() of "i+1"
perfectly matches when it is "i" the next time through the loop.

IMHO This means altering your entire procedure of calculating. You're using
separate calcs for dx, dx2 (etc) pairs of all your variables.
These do not always overlap - so you get cracks.

Ideally re-parameterize so that each time through the loop the same value is
calculated.
Basically drop the second calc entirely and just make one. Increment your
index to get each profile.


So form of result could be something like this but does not have to be in
list form. (I'm just trying to make code clear)...
diameters = list_of_inner_diameters(); // a list generated somehow
radii = list_of_radii(); // a list generated somehow - same length
positions = list_of_translations(); //  - same length
angles = list_of_rotations(); //  - same length

for (i=[0:1:len(diameters)-1])
   hull() {
      translate(positions[i])
      rotate(angles[i])
         cylinder(diameters[i], r=radii[i], center=false);
      // next step
      translate(positions[i+1])
      rotate(angles[i+1])
         cylinder(diameters[i+1], r=radii[i+1], center=false);
   }


You can see what's wrong if you change the following to larger numbers like
these
- delta = 16; // in module calyx()
- d=1; // in module cylinder_pie()


// object: bass clarinet bell

maxheight = 160;     // Height
d_btm_inside = 25;   // dia at base
d_btm_wall =  10;    // outer base dia (added to d_btm_inside)
d_top_inside = 144;  // dia of flare
d_top_wall = 16;      // notional thickness...

Hi,
for sure  Neon22 is a programmer and an OpenSCAD expert.  The bulge() module
he offers takes into account the way OpenSCAD evaluates it's expressions and
calls itself in the end.
I'm not a programmer and I like the things more linear.
So if you are a beginner maybe, you will be more comfortable with the
following variation of bulge():

width = 10; 
height = 30; 
length = 100; 
step =1; 

module bulge1() { 
   difference() { 
       cube(size=[width-1, length, height], center=true); 
            translate([0,0,height/2]) 
               for (i=[0:step:length]) { 
                  hull () { 
                     cube(size=[width, length*(i/length),
cos(i*(length/45))*height], center=true); 
                     cube(size=[width, length*((i+step)/length),
cos((i+step)*(length/45))*height], center=true); 
                } 
          }	
     } 
}

bulge1();

Thanks Neon22 I'm also learning from you.

This looks like a question for MakerBot support. I cannot reproduce this error on my end, so I suspect this is related to some of the processing done in MakerBot Cusomizer?s proprietary server code.

I installed new video card drivers yesterday and now when I start OpenSCAD
in displays the initial open recent files window, not matter what option I
choose New or Open Recent, Open Example, etc, the window goes away and
OpenSCAD never starts and there is no process running and no error message
of any kind.  This happens on all versions of OpenSCAD even the 3 older
versions you posted.  So I am guessing there is something screwy with my
system.  Not sure how to proceed from here.  Maybe I can try doing a system
restore in Windows and rolling back installed updates.

Actually the oldest version posted  (OpenSCAD-2014.03-x86-64.zip
<http://files.openscad.org/OpenSCAD-2014.03-x86-64.zip>) did run but failed
to compile my library but it does work correctly with the examples.

Another diagnostics idea:
Test MeshLab: http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/

MeshLab is well known and use the same GUI framework as OpenSCAD.
If that also fails, we?ve isolated the problem quite a bit.

great Neon22, many thanks!!!

I modified the code according to your suggestions. Only I could not find a
way to fill a list, but it could be all done by functions. The result was
the rendering went much faster. Maybe that is already a sign that there are
no very complex things anymore. F6 rendering

Thanks. That, together with the fact that MeshLab works, points towards that this has something to do with us upgrading from Qt4 to Qt5.

Does anyone know about any other Qt5-based 3D software we could test against?

@jpmendes Looks good.
The reason I did my approach (putting it into its own module) was so it
could be differenced from anything you want to subtract it from.

I see the original poster used, as reference, a card carrying unit with
several compartments.
So the bulge module could be subtracted (using difference) from any object
by positioning it and calling it several times.

E.g. (with some improvements)
wall_width = 10;
wall_height = 30;

module bulge(length, width, height) {
	step = 1; // how smooth
	count = 100;
	for (i=[0:step:count]) {
		hull () {
			cube(size=[width, length*(i/count), cos(i*(count/45))*height],
center=true);
			cube(size=[width, length*((i+1)/count), cos((i+1)*(count/45))*height],
center=true);
		}
	}	
}


difference() {
	cube(size=[100, 100, wall_height], center=true);
	#translate([50,0,wall_height/2])
		bulge(100,wall_width,wall_height/2);
	translate([-30,0,wall_height/2])
		bulge(200,wall_width,wall_height);
	translate([0,0,wall_height/2])
		bulge(100,wall_width,wall_height);
}

sorry - its the last version of Deep Exploration which got sold to SAP and
therefore is no longer available to mere mortals. I don't like to tell
people what it is because they just can't get it anymore :(
For polygonal 3D modelling I prefer wings3d as it produces watertight models
by default. Its internal structure is edge based and not face based like
most modellers.

I am not convinced that you are using the right approach. Using hull() for
nonlinear stuff like this will not make you happy.

Tried to model it using my sweep() function, just for fun, and without
having a closer look at your data. 

The code renders very fast - also in CGAL. Seems like this a good show case
for my nSpline() function, which I still haven't published. It interpolates
the coordinates, the radius and the angle. 
Instead of using nSpline() you can compose the data yourself, using your
functions.

Then again - if its rounded coreners you want @VIQleS then the simplest - but
least efficient - method is the minkowski.
E.g. in place of above example
Note - set sphere_res = 4 initially. then try 20 but wait a long time.
Also tray(); call at bottom takes argument true/false to enable rounding. So
you can run it with false and have quick feedback and only enable slow
minkowski rounding when you have model all sorted out and can afford to wait
:)

wall_width = 10;
wall_height = 30;
// how detailed is the rounding.
sphere_res = 4;  // 4=3mins but facets. 20=12mins and smooth

module bulge(length, width, height) {
	step = 1; // how smooth
	count = 100;
	for (i=[1:step:count]) {
		hull () {
			cube(size=[width, length*(i/count), cos(i*(count/45))*height],
center=true);
			cube(size=[width, length*((i+1)/count), cos((i+1)*(count/45))*height],
center=true);
		}
	}	
}


module tray(rounding=false) {
	minkowski() {
		difference() {
			cube(size=[100, 100, wall_height], center=true);
			// the indents
			translate([50,0,wall_height/2])
				bulge(100,wall_width,wall_height/2);
			translate([-30,0,wall_height/2])
				bulge(200,wall_width,wall_height);
			translate([0,0,wall_height/2])
				bulge(100,wall_width,wall_height);
		}
		if (rounding)
			sphere(d=3, $fn=sphere_res);
	}
}

tray();      // no rounding
// tray(true);  // corners rounded but takes a while...

That's almost exactly what I want - is there a way of doing a convex curve
near the top of the indent as per:

@Johan list comprehensions are what you're looking for.
Special section on cheatsheet - http://www.openscad.org/cheatsheet/  look at
"Generate"
more info here: https://github.com/openscad/list-comprehension-demos


For rotation you could do something like this:

function calc_rotation(from, step, to) = [ for (i = [from : step : to])
rotatie_top*i/100 ];
delta=4;
echo(calc_rotation(0, delta, 100 - 4*delta));

giving:
ECHO: [0, 1.8, 3.6, 5.4, 7.2, 9, 10.8, 12.6, 14.4, 16.2, 18, 19.8, 21.6,
23.4, 25.2, 27, 28.8, 30.6, 32.4, 34.2, 36, 37.8]

Hi Michael,
Thnx for the heads up. I'm new to the mailinglist type of forum. Seems
'complicated', but I'll find out what it's all about soon enough. I've
subscribed to this list. I hope to learn a lot more about OpenSCAD and
contribute to the forum if I can.
Willem

Message-ID: <CAMyDR6+Ut1Uht3GWLpeFVbvp=UYBCsHwsgEAyrz=NxJC9nJyLQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have made a handle for a cup.
I want the handle to be rounded on the edges.
I tried using minkowski() on the part with a sphere, but alas when I
preview, it goes into LA LA Land, and I have to eventually, kill the
process.

Here is my code:

module handle_outline() {
  linear_extrude(height=6, convexity=2)
    hull() {
      circle(r=12, center=true);
      translate([20,0,0]) circle(r=3, center=true);
    }
}

module handle() {
  intersection() {
    difference() {
      handle_outline();
      translate([0,0,-2]) scale([0.65,0.65,2.0]) handle_outline();
    }
    translate([5,20,0]) cube([40,40,12], center=true);
  }
}

scale([1,1.5,1]) handle();


Thanks,
Jerry

It depends how you define La La Land and what you have $fn set to.

This previews in 45 seconds for me and looks reasonable:

minkowski() {
 scale([1,1.5,1]) handle();
 sphere(2, $fn = 32);
}

 Increase $fn  and fn_sphere slowly.
This takes 19 sec on my machine.
?

$fn=32;
fn_sphere=16;

module handle_outline() {
    hull() {
      circle(r=12, center=true);

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Loading a file automatically preview in Windows 10
Message-ID: <1449858811343-15106.post@n5.nabble.com>

Just got a new laptop with Windows 10 pro. I installed both OpenScad
2015.03-2 and 2015.10.17 snapshot.

I am surprised to find that, in both versions, when loading a file, it is
automatically previewed. This never happened when I was using Linux.

Is this an intended behavior ? (but not so in Linux)

When in Linux, in some occasions when my code goes into endless recursion or
whatever reasons freezes, I could at least restart Openscad, reload the file
and make corrections before preview. This is impossible if it is
auto-preview when loading.

Design->Automatic Reload and Preview.

I believe it should be off by default, but keep in mind that settings are shared between OpenSCAD versions and possibly kept between uninstalls/reinstalls.

great! that worked. I meant by la la land was that the process looked like
it went into a endless loop.
peter put me on the right track! thanks peter.

Here's my full code if anyone is interested:

$fn=50;
fn_sphere=16;
fn_cup = 100;

want_handle = true;
want_cup = true;

module handle_outline() {
  linear_extrude(height=6, convexity=2)
    hull() {
      circle(r=15, center=true);
      translate([20,0,0]) circle(r=3, center=true);
    }
}

module handle() {
  intersection() {
    difference() {
      handle_outline();
      translate([0,0,-2]) scale([0.85,0.85,2.0]) handle_outline();
    }
    translate([5,20,0]) cube([40,40,12], center=true);
  }
}

module cup() {
  difference() {
    union() {
      translate([0,0,20]) rotate_extrude(angle=360, convexity=2)
translate([20,0,0]) circle(r=4, center=true, $fn=fn_cup);
      translate([0,0,-20]) rotate_extrude(angle=360, convexity=2)
translate([20,0,0]) circle(r=4, center=true, $fn=fn_cup);
      cylinder(r=23.5, h = 44, center=true, $fn=fn_cup);
    }
    cylinder(r=20, h=50, center=true, $fn=fn_cup);
  }

  translate([0,0,-22]) cylinder(r=22, h=3, center=true, $fn=fn_cup);
}

if (want_cup)
  cup();

if (want_handle) {
  translate([-3,22,5]) rotate([0,90,0]) scale([1,1.5,1])
    difference(){
      minkowski(){
          handle();
          sphere(2,$fn=fn_sphere);
      }
     translate([0,-40,0])cube(80,true);
  }
}

Arrhhh ... so embarrassing. Didn't even think of the  Design->Automatic
Reload and Preview setting ...

Both versions are freshly installed the very first time in this laptop,
though. Besides, the last time and only time I used that setting was about
one year ago. So it seems unlikely that it's turned on manually.

Anyhow, even so users can just turn it off. That's good enough.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Difference/intersection object disappears at preview in
	Windows 10
Message-ID: <1449865284882-15113.post@n5.nabble.com>

Just testing my new Windows 10 pro (on a HP laptop with Intel? Core(TM)
i5-6200U Processor 2.3 GHz) using the following simple code:

difference() // or use intersection()
{
    cube([4,4,4]);
    sphere(2);
}


and found that 

(1) at some angles it shows only the intact cube; 
(2) at some angles it shows only the intact sphere (or intact negative
sphere if using difference() )
(3) at all other angles there's nothing in the preview;

So if I use the mouse to move it around, roughly about 80% of the time it
shows nothing, 10% cube and 10% sphere (or negative sphere).

Also found that:

4) without diff / intersection, both cube and/or sphere shows up normally
(either together or one at a time)
5) render (F6) is normal;
6) hull() is normal;
7) happens in both 2015.03-2 and 2015.10.17 versions 

So somehow this Win 10 pro causes difference()/interaction() to behave
abnormally in preview.

This seems to be the same or similar issue as posted by hamster earlier:

Preview not working with Intel GPUs (was: 2015.03 preview not working)
<http://forum.openscad.org/Preview-not-working-with-Intel-GPUs-was-2015-03-preview-not-working-td12101.html>  

And his solution:

> Both versions work correctly on Intel graphics if I check the box "force
> Goldfeather" in preferences. 

works in my case.

On Windows, it will be in the registry.

So far there appears to be NO win10 drivers for the IntelHD graphics cards
that work without "Goldfeather" option.
Not required for Nvidia drivers.

Its possibly the association list in the options.
/* [Show/Hide] */
show_axis = "yes"; //["yes":Yes, "no":No]
show_master = "no"; //["yes":Yes, "no":No]
show_sprue = "no"; //["yes":Yes, "no":No]

show_mould_bottom = "yes"; //["yes":Yes, "no":No]
show_mould_top = "yes"; //["yes":Yes, "no":No]

Try using this instead:
show_axis = "yes"; //[yes,no]

I know - we really need a Windows developer with access with such a system.
It could be buggy drivers, but I feel that Intel should have gotten their GPU drivers under control by now.

This looks good.
I hope they start printing now, but because I plan some other non lineaur
stuff like mouthpieces I will try to find out how I get your functions doing
my object. I will let you now.

But maybe good to understand.
What you do is define some points and rotation of one side of the object in
A.
Then you calculate a spline. Do I understand that a spline is an
interpolation curve between the points in A. Is B then only an interpolated
line? And does 100 mean the number of point you generate?
Then you generate data. Does this make all the points of the object?
Then you do a sweep. Does this fill the area between the points?

In another project I'm working on, the OpenGL support for IntelHD is missing
for line widths in outline mode and dot width for dots. Having to use
spheres instead.
I think the Intel HD drivers are just subpar. We will have to wait for them
to improve. I don't think its a coding issue on OpenSCAD side. It just
doesn't work.

Of course.
Here's a much improved Bulge as well. Works properly now - unlike the
rubbish I posted before.
The approach below uses Hull() a lot which is a bit slow.
Also the rounding uses Minkowski() which is exceedingly slow.
Increase smoothing params with care.
 - Commented out options at the end....

// For Bulge
wall_width = 10;
wall_height = 30;
curve_res = 20;  // for bulge - 100 is high quality

// how smooth is the rounding.
sphere_res = 4;  // 4=3mins but facets. 20=12mins and smooth


// Bulge based on sin()
module bulge(length, width, height, samples=100) {
	// samples = smoothness of curve (20..100)
	stride = length/(samples+1); // each step is this long
	for (i=[0:1:samples-1]) {
		hull () {
			translate([0,stride*i,0])
				cube(size=[width, stride, sin(180*((i==0) ? 0.01: i)/samples)*height]);
			translate([0,stride*(i+1),0])
				cube(size=[width, stride, sin(180*(i+0.99)/samples)*height]);
		}
	}
}

// Easein/out shaped curve (combined Bulges)
module ease(length, width, height, extra=0.1) {
	part = length/2;
	translate([0,part/2,height/2])
	difference() {
		union() {
		// add together central bulge and filler underneath
			translate([0,0,-extra/2])
			bulge(part, width, height/2, curve_res);
			translate([width/2,part/2,-extra/2-height/4])
				cube(size=[width-.01,part*2,extra+height/2], center=true);
		}
		// subtract the inverted outer curves
		mirror([0,0,1]) {
			translate([0,-part,-extra/2])
				bulge(part, width, height/2, curve_res);
			translate([0,part,-extra/2])
				bulge(part, width, height/2, curve_res);
		}
	}
}


module tray(rounding=false) {
	minkowski() {
		difference() {
			cube(size=[100, 100, wall_height], center=true);
			// the indents
			mirror([0,0,1]) {
				translate([45,-25,-wall_height/2])
					ease(50,wall_width,wall_height/2);
				translate([-30,-44,-wall_height/2])
					ease(88,wall_width,wall_height/4);
				translate([0,-25,-wall_height/2])
					ease(50,wall_width,wall_height/6);
			}
		}
		if (rounding)
			sphere(d=3, $fn=sphere_res);
	}
}

tray();      // no rounding
// tray(true);  // corners rounded but takes a while...
// bulge(100,10,30);
// ease(100,10,30);

Probably on a totally different tangent, why do you want to model the 
horn/bell of a Bass Clarinet??

I am interested in music and play in a community orchestra.  The Bass 
Clarinetist has probably THE most expensive instrument and it a really 
interesting instrument so for all the "non SCAD" reasons I am interested 
in your aims.  Could you elaborate please (in a quick way that does not 
clog up this discussion) what the project is about, or is it just a 
theoretical investigation???

Cheers, Rob

Hello Rob,

I am repairing saxophone for a few years now and was interested in repairing
bass clarinets too because I started to play the instrument a year ago. I
practice repairing by buying cheap instruments and fix them and then sell
them. I bought a bass clarinet without a bell and neck a mounth ago. Because
it was a plastic bass clarinet I thought that it would interesting to print
the quite expensive bell and see what the results would be. When I tried to
make the first designs I was infected by the 3D virus. I don't know how to
cure from that ;-).

I have a lot of other things in mind: a bass clarinet extension from low Eb
to low C for instance.

regards,
Johan

We may need to start a new thread Johan, but that is very interesting to 
me.  The technicalities of rendering an instrument that has been worked 
out by people with exquisite musical sensory faculties eg Stradivarius,  
just to quote one very famous one, is very intriguing.  It is also 
tantalising to think, if the experts of old could be paralleled by 
modern technology, and especially the recent trigonometric precision of 
the combination of a software package like 'openSCAD' and a 3-D printer, 
whether anything can  be improved, or maybe just happy to be replicated? 
My fascination with the shapes of instruments and a fairly primitive 
knowledge of trigonometry and other functions etc makes me wonder what 
is possible?

OpenSCAD may have to start a 'counseling' thread for people trying to 
not think of their daily lives being consumed by the thought "now, if 
only I could print.....".

Returning to your challenge.  Changing the tuning would be awesome, and 
a huge challenge (mainly for the challenges mentioned above). To alter 
the bell and still rely on the established keying structure of the rest 
of the instrument, ie not have to rebuild the whole thing, would be very 
difficult would it not???

<jest> Maybe one day in openSCAD one could produce the Stradivarius.stl 
and make one!  </jest>

Cheers Rob

Hi!

I second this (old) proposition; I rarely need a cube centered on its 3
axes, and always have to use translate() to move, which is pretty annoying.
Especially when using global consts (for parametric code), it leads to
XXX/2, YYY/2...

Thanks,

PS : sphere is also not consistant with cylinder/cube, as it is always
centered...

Yes, yes and yes. You got it!

what sweep() does is meshing a N-series of (non-self-intersecting)
M-polygons moved along a trajectory into a polyhedron - just like
linear_extrude(). Leaving linear_extrude() behind you gain a lot of freedom,
while taking full responsibility in avoiding self-intersection. 

1. You can compose your own trajectory using affine operations (scale,
rotation and translation) and apply it to any series of M-polygons (a series
of circle shapes with growing radii in your case). Usually you chose a chord
line (e.g. the path the mass point would follow in 3D space) as basic
trajectory and then apply your operations (in any order) to the polygons. 

2. Also the function that generates your slices may have parameters (e.g.
your radius) ? more generally think of a windmill blade being composed from
a series of airfoil data each being described with 5 or more parameters, and
translated and rotated in space.  

As all this needs a lot data to be carefully arranged. To do this in an
"organic" way I use a trick. Interpolation with nSpline(). It works
multidimensional (P) and interpolates a given LxP-polygon (L point sets of
dimension P) into a more or less "equally" spaced KxP-polygon. In effect it
transforms a LxP into a KxP Matrix by filling in the missing rows in
between. So, each P-vector comprises your translation, rotation, scale
parameters (the so called finite operation space, which may be restricted to
a subspace like a 3D-translation followed by a 1D-rotation in your case)
*plus* any parameters (e.g. your radius) you need to generate the M-polygon
for a single slice.

For your application case, I would say, interpolation is the royal road. You
measure the thing at some characteristic positions and with only a few
points you'll get a perfecty organic looking hull. 

Of course one would be better off using ?known? functions to generate the
rows in a more precise descriptive way, but finding these functions can be
quite tedious, depending on the problem and the dimensionality. The more
"organic" freedom you want, the more dimensions you get, the harder your
work.

nSpline() is based on the natural cubic spline and not always the best
approach. There are many other interpolation schemes known, like other
spline types and/or with different order, Bezi?rs and so on. This is a large
field in Mathematics. 

Here's another example showing the support points as spheres in red and the
inserted points in yellow: 

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n15129/showcase2.png>  

Please let me know, whether the sound resulting from your printed instrument
part is acceptable. The application field is enormous! I'll publish
nSpline() as soon as I have fully tested it and implemented some convincing
show cases. I'd send you a "beta" via PM, if you wanna play with it.

You can implement features of this kind easily as your own library and
include it into you projects.

Hi all,

I haven?t had the time to digest the last long email threads, but in this particular case, has anyone looked at the skin() function in list-comprehension-demos?
https://github.com/openscad/list-comprehension-demos#extrusionscad

..it could be easier to use than doing a sweep.

Things like skin.scad look really interesting but I can't figure out how they
are supposed to be used, by just looking at the code. (e.g. augment_profile
augments the profile with Steiner points. but what...?)

Is it possible to make some samples files which exercise all the aspects of
each of these files in the list_comprehensions folder ?

Sure, but:

1) is there any reason not to put it as a native feature?

2) what about perfs? I guess it would be much faster if native...

Please try with the latest release. I can reproduce the crash with
2015.03-1 but not with 2015.03-2 (on Linux).

Um, why not explain what you are trying to do?

While I'm motivated to help, I'm not going to reverse engineer the

Well, your proposal is in principle not bad. I also often missed this
feature. 

@Kintel
In my eyes one would be better off having an *automatically included
standard library*, where stuff like that is rewritable without having to put
further burden to the dev team. If there was also a qualified naming scheme
in OpenSCAD, the implementation could even be made fully transparent. This
would also be the perfect place to put in other customizations, like
includes for other libraries.

@fma
Be assured, you won't notice any increase in execution time with code like
this:  

> module yourcube(size = [1,1,1], center = false)
> {
>   sz = (len(size) == 3)?size:[size,size,size];

I was trying to get the loop to emit a series of 16 [x,y] positions to 
create the shape.  The details of exactly which points are where is 
probably irrelevant.

Like so for an ellipse?:

function shape() = [ for (a = [0 : 35]) [ 5 * sin(a * 10), 8 * cos(a * 10) ] ];

// easy way to test just the shape :-)
polygon(shape());

-----

Or to show the separate things going on in more detail:

function x(a) = (10 + sin(a * 10)) * sin(a);

function y(a) = (10 + sin(a * 10)) * cos(a);

function point(a) = [ x(a), y(a) ];

function shape() = [ for (a = [0 : 359]) point(a) ];

polygon(shape());

ciao,
  Torsten.

Thanks.  Those examples helped a lot in getting the syntax tweaked!

This heavily depends on what kind of sweep() or skin() you use. Don't know
whether you have  looked at the code
<http://forum.openscad.org/Rendering-fails-difference-between-F5-and-F6-tp15041p15100.html> 
?
I am using an own version from NacaSweep.scad described  here
<http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:900137>  , which is much more basic than
the "official" one you might know, as it knits just a matrix (a vector of
vectors describing a series of non-intersecting polygons already placed in
3D space) into a polyhedron. 
Before I decided to implement this version, I tried out the "official" one
and found it too complicated and restricted for my purposes - beside the
lack of documentation also in code.

I guess there's full agreement on that. The issue list already contains
a number of things that would be nice and simple candidates for inclusion

e.g.:
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/1517
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/821

(Hmm, one of the 821 related issues might need to be reopened?!)

The challenges are "only":
- No namespace support yet (MCAD dev works around that using mcad_ prefix)
- Needs quite some work to define a stable API (maybe using some kind of
  staging area first which gives a warning for new stuff that might still
  be changed)
- Needs lots of work to maintain once it's used in various projects
- Needs a good name :-)

ciao,
  Torsten.

This is an old subject. But this is what I use to solve it:

    intersection()
    {
        rotate_extrude()
        {
            translate([20,0,0]) square([4,2]);
        }
        hull()
        {
            rotate(0) cube([0.1,100,100]);
            rotate(90) cube([0.1,100,100]);
        }  
    }

Nice - I?ll try to have a look.
The purpose of the ?official? sweep and skin is to explore the functionality and interface of such functions, in order to make better decision when eventually creating built-in and long-term supported implementations of it.

If you could provide some insights into what you need, what was missing in the original implementation etc., that would be very helpful.

I never played around with skin(). But as far as I remember, I didn't like
the interface of sweep(), as its prototyp was too restricting. I'm talking
about this one


> module sweep(shape, path_transforms, closed=false)

1. It doesn't allow for a parametrization of *shape*, 
2. It restricts *path-transforms* to finite operations
3. I'm not a friend of multmatrix and representations of similar complexity

So I decided to reimplement it, just demanding a regular matrix - which
represents a series of polygons in 3D-space as already mentioned. This
series may be freely composed: using any kind of transformations, finite and
non-linear in any order, interpolation schemes (e.g. nSpline()) and
unlimitedly parametrized shapes (e.g. airfoils with non-linear transitions
along the path). 
See my example of a loop propeller (also just a fast scetch for this post),
using a 7D interpolation. I guess you can read my shortcuts: R, Rx, Tx and
so on operate over objects, Rx_ Tz_ and so operate over vectors (shapes)

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n15160/showcase3.png> 

and without interpolation 

> C = gen_dat(A, 100);   // generate data

you'll still get this

Hi,
I took some time to generalize your idea.
Here it goes:

DefaultFaces=24;

module Tube_Sect(Height,Dout,Din,StartAngle,EndAngle,Faces) {
			
  StartAngle= (StartAngle < 0) ? 360+StartAngle : StartAngle;
  EndAngle= (EndAngle < 0) ? 360+EndAngle : EndAngle;
  EndAngle2 =  (EndAngle < StartAngle) ? StartAngle : EndAngle;
  StartAngle2 =  (EndAngle < StartAngle) ? EndAngle : StartAngle;
	
	
	if (EndAngle2-StartAngle2<360){
	
	   NSides= (Faces < 3 || Faces==undef)  ?  DefaultFaces : Faces;
	   n=floor((EndAngle2-StartAngle2)/120);
	   Sect1=EndAngle2-StartAngle2-n*120;
	   Sect2= (n>0) ? 120 : 0;
	   Sect3=(n>1) ? 120 : 0;

	   intersection(){
	      rotate_extrude(convexity=2,

This sounds exactly like skin(), as used here:

Does that differ in any way, if so, what are you missing from skin()?

Meanwhile I had a look at your skin() example. You are right, obviously
skin() and my sweep() are at least syntactically interchangeable and give
the same results on my examples - however the implementations differ a lot.
Is/was it part of any libary? Anyway, in environments without debugging
facilities I always prefer to use my own code :-)

Thanks jpmendes, most impressive demonstration.
While I can see a lot of debate goes into refining the power of the 
openSCAD programming language and how it is rendered, I am also 
privileged to observe the evolution of extremely powerful design tools 
that smart people will apply to solve many problems.  Creating a really 
good musical instrument in conventional materials is very hard, and not 
to be dismissed lightly, but, when design software, for example 
openSCAD, and material improvements are accumulated over time, then the 
gap will be gradually closed.  I hope the conventional instruments 
continue to be made, but I think the understanding of how what makes a 
good instrument 'good' will be understood so much better when 3-D 
productions tools allow experimentation inside well defined parameters 
to be made reliably.
The idea of creating the "formula" for a bell horn of a bass clarinet is 
a step in that direction.
I am sure if there was time, the "back-end" stories to most of the 
openSCAD forum discussions, would be equally inspiring.
Cheers, Rob

Well Hugo <Nabble> fixed it, I clicked on it & it disappeared.
I'm assuming that's it, so let me know if you see pop-ups.

It is not showing on this test account so it looks like it is not a per user

It?s part of the exploration of new functionality. I?m interested in whether this is a good function to offer, what sort of added/changed features are needed and interface ideas.

I guess you know that my answer will be yes. Connected with an interpolation
scheme it is really powerful.

I just had a look, how skin() behaves when it has to connect polygons with
different number of points (mine doesn't do that at all for a good reason).
The result is somehow unexpected.

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n15170/showcase5.png> 

Why would one split the lines of a polygon? Is this semantics a hack? I'd
expect unpaired triangles as natural semantics. And I would also expect the
result to be convex (at least in this case).

And an immediate feature request would be: adding furcations like a
bifurcation and an inverse (anastomosis) to it. 
a bifurcation matrix would be 
[... [...], [...], [[...], [...]], ...] 

and the inverse: 
[... [[...], [...]], [...], [...], ... ]

It is easy to calculate furcations, but hard to connect them in a proper way
using OpenSCAD language means.

Yes, the Steiner point insertion is a bit automagic. Not sure I would call it unexpected though - the screenshot you posted is dominated by effects of polygon tessellation. Since we cannot represent non-planar polygons like that, we have to make a tessellation discussion. The actual Steiner point insertion kind of makes sense. Ideas are welcome.

That would be cool - perhaps something to leave for the future.
As always, if we can prototype partial functionality in user-space, that would help understand it.
If there are missing features in the OpenSCAD language which makes this hard, we could address that in a separate project.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Dimension/Parameter labeling for part diagrams
Message-ID: <CAFoRp-PCKfNia1qouGYH-W3W2E5QFBJRCgCi2CkwBEMitx+mMA@mail.gmail.com>

When making parametric scripts, sometimes its hard to describe what each
parameter does without a visual aid.  So I thought it would be nice if
there was some modules to help label parameters.

The idea is to be able to create technical part diagrams such as this:
http://us.misumi-ec.com/item/10300258330/img/drw_01.gif

The various part dimensions are given variable names, then those names
could correspond to the variables in the script itself.

Alternatively to showing variable names, you could make display the actual
dimensions in unit values:
http://www.ucl.ac.uk/earth-sciences/people/personalpages/bowles/images/Tech_Drawing.jpg

http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110503165248/lego/images/5/5a/Technical_drawing_minifigure.png

(all linked pics are more or less randomly pulled from google image search)

I'm not aware of any other libraries designed to do this so, I developed my
own module.  Attached is an example that mostly does what I have in mind.
I still need to create something for labeling angles, and probably another
for labeling radii.

the module signature right now is:
module dimension(txt, l, size=1, offset1=0, offset2=0, dir=[1,0,0],
angle=0, color1="red")

-txt is the label string
-l is the length of dimension being labeled
-size is the size of the label text; the line width and arrows etc are also
derived from this
-offset1 determines where the text is put along the dimension, 0 is
centered, and positive or negative values go on either side outside the
dimension bounds
-offset2 is how far the "vertical" lines extend, perpendicular to the
dimension itself
-dir is a vector in the direction along the dimension
-angle is how the label is rotated about the dir vector

In the script I have attempted to demonstrate the various configurations
for using it.

Let me know if you find this useful, if the parameters make sense, or other
suggestions for improvements.

Thanks,
Hans

I wouldn't say it makes sense in this specific situation, as Steiner points
are mainly meant for mesh repair purposes in odd non-planar situations like
z-fighting. Modelling the same thing using hull() gives exactly the expected
behavior - unpaired triangles.

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n15173/showcase7.png> 

and here: left is hull, right is Steiner point. What would you expect? 

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n15173/showcase6.png> 

or look at this: 

> r=50;
> height=140;

>   i==0?circle($fn=6+47*i,r=r): [[0,0], [0,10]]) ]); 

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n15173/showcase8.png> 

So, if I wanted Steiner point semantics, I could refine the 2D-shape in
principle myself. But if skin() does Steiner point semantics unwantedly, I
don't have any means to prevent it. 
One could offer Steiner point semantics as a flavor by adding a mode
attribute, but I guess this is not necessary, as the Steiner regularization
used by skin() is easily done by a an own function (and in a more problem
specific manner) when preparing the dataset.

I'll do the job and implement it in a more generic (=inefficient) way and on
the basis of my sweep() - as it is already on my todo list. 

What makes it hard? Implementing matrix related stuff in OpenSCAD is so
painful - especially if you're committed more to imperative programming.
Think about an NxMxL matrix A and you want to alter some value, say A[10]
[101][100]. In OpenSCAD you have to go through three loops, get thousands of
copies of copies ... 
See e.g. also the fibonacci discussion in the thingiverse  OpenSCAD group
<http://www.thingiverse.com/groups/openscad/topic:3916#comment-732942>  
which is kind of absurd, as fibonacci is a recursive problem. But runtime is
runtime.

@MichaeltOz

thanks! Your hint was good. I looked into the Nabble thread again and found
the cause. After forcing a reload of the forum, it is gone. Was a cache
thing.

@ thehans: Pretty cool, especially the "following cam" one. 

I've tried both libs mentioned by Torstan and Peter. The one by  Don Smiley
<http://www.cannymachines.com/entries/9/openscad_dimensioned_drawings>   is,
in my mind, the godfather of dimension drawing in OpenSCAD. It can do a lot
of different drawings, produces clean and well spaced (relatively speaking)
output (the font is ugly, though). It is a bit hard to use (for me).  But in
my opinion, for anyone wants to develop a dimension lib, this is the one
worth studying. 

wifibum's version
<http://www.cannymachines.com/entries/9/openscad_dimensioned_drawings>   has
much more limited use comparing to Smiley's. Also the displayed font doesn't
look comfortable. 

Both versions are out-dated 'cos they use 3rd-party text writing lib but not
the current text() built-in.

I also have developed a dimension feature as part of my lib, used in a 
thread <http://forum.openscad.org/OpenSCAD-and-Woodworking-td13966.html>  
earlier: 

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13966/201509_CornerShelf_Dim.png> 

The most significant difference of my approach is that -- instead of writing
a string around the origin ( [0,0,0] ) then moving it to destination -- it
measures the distance between two given points and display it. The function
call is like:

> Dim( [P,Q,R], options )

where P,Q are the distance to be measured and R determines the plane to draw
on. 

Certainly, this approach makes sense only if P,Q are readily available,
which is not the case in most OpenSCAD applications unless you are working
on polyhedron objects.

Wow I guess I should have asked on the lists instead of on IRC before
making it.  Didn't know its been done so many times.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] This seems to be ultra basic. I cannot have the
 rotate_extrude angle parameter working.
Message-ID: <1450210573250-15180.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi,

I'm using OpenSCAD version 2015.03-2 
What is wrong in the code bellow? I cannot get a 45? section of a tube, I
get 360?  rotation only.

The Wiki says:

?Usage[edit]
rotate_extrude(angle = 360, convexity = 2) {...}
You must use parameter names due to a backward compatibility issue. ?

What does the previous line mean?

The code:
============

DefaultSides=24;
module Tube(Length,Dout,Din,Sides,Angl)  
{			
    NSides= (Sides < 3 || Sides==undef)  ?  DefaultSides : Sides;

    rotate_extrude(angle=Angl, convexity=2, $fn=NSides ) 
		translate([Din/2,0,0]) 
			square([(Dout-Din)/2,Length]); 
}
//Example:
Tube (Length=100,Dout=30,Din=25,Sides=90,Angl=45);

======

I had to figure how to do the same, making the module bellow based on a
Johan Jonker code sugestion:

=========
DefaultFaces=24;

module Tube_Sect(Height,Dout,Din,StartAngle,EndAngle,Faces) {
			
	StartAngle= (StartAngle < 0) ? 360+StartAngle : StartAngle;
	EndAngle= (EndAngle < 0) ? 360+EndAngle : EndAngle;
	echo(StartAngle, EndAngle);
	EndAngle2 =  (EndAngle < StartAngle) ? StartAngle : EndAngle;
        StartAngle2 =  (EndAngle < StartAngle) ? EndAngle : StartAngle;
	
	
	if (EndAngle2-StartAngle2<360){
	
		NSides= (Faces < 3 || Faces==undef)  ?  DefaultFaces : Faces;
		n=floor((EndAngle2-StartAngle2)/120);
		Sect1=EndAngle2-StartAngle2-n*120;
		Sect2= (n>0) ? 120 : 0;
		Sect3=(n>1) ? 120 : 0;

	 intersection(){
		rotate_extrude(, $fn=floor(NSides*360/(EndAngle2-StartAngle2))) 
		       translate([Din/2,0,0]) square([(Dout-Din)/2,Height]); 
		
		  union(){
				hull(){
					rotate(StartAngle2) cube([0.001,Dout,Height+1]); 
					rotate((StartAngle2+Sect1)) cube([0.001,Dout,Height+1]);
				}
					hull(){
					rotate((StartAngle2+Sect1)) cube([0.001,Dout,Height+1]); 
					rotate((StartAngle2+Sect1+Sect2)) cube([0.001,Dout,Height+1]);
				}
					hull(){
					rotate((StartAngle2+Sect1+Sect2)) cube([0.001,Dout,Height+1]); 
					rotate((StartAngle2+Sect1+Sect2+Sect3)) cube([0.001,Dout,Height+1]);
				}
			}		
		}
		} else { echo("Only rotations less than 360 degrees are supported");}
		
}
//Test examples:
//translate([30,0,0]) 
//Tube_Sect(Height=20, Dout=30, Din=20, StartAngle=0, EndAngle=359.9999,
Faces=3);
//translate([-30,0,0]) 
//Tube_Sect(Height=20, Dout=30, Din=20, StartAngle=0, EndAngle=359.9999,
Faces=5);

//Left rotation 
Tube_Sect(Height=40,Dout=20,Din=12,StartAngle=0,EndAngle=259,Faces=20);
//Right rotation
//translate([0,30,0]) 
//Tube_Sect(Height=40,Dout=20,Din=12,StartAngle=-0.0001,EndAngle=-259,Faces=20);
//Complementary right rotation
//translate([0,-30,0]) 
//Tube_Sect(Height=40,Dout=20,Din=12,StartAngle=-0.0001,EndAngle=259,Faces=20);
// Complementary right rotation
//translate([0,-60,0]) 
//Tube_Sect(Height=40,Dout=20,Din=12,StartAngle=0,EndAngle=-259,Faces=20);

=======

Thanks in advance

The angle was added recently and is not in any stable release yet.

The wiki has a note next to the angle parameter description:
[Note: Requires version 2016.XX]
That means its scheduled to be in the *next* upcoming release.

For now you can get this feature through the nightly dev releases.

The line you asked about:
You must use parameter names due to a backward compatibility issue.

Just means it won't work if you omit the parameter names and try to rely on
the ordering of the parameters alone(as is possible with many other
openscad functions).  Your code looks fine in that regard, since you are
specifying the names "angle=..."

I've done a fast implementation of a bifurcation on the basis of skin() and
the proposed representation scheme. It showed me, that there is no "natural"
semantics in implementing it. 
There is a root part, child parts and a connector. The connector is the salt
in the soup. I think it needs either some problem specific treatment or if
it is generated automatically at least some interpolation scheme like
B-spline to provide a good approximation of the transition. The stuff can
(and should) be put into library first, to see how it works. This will take
time.

Thanks Hans,

It is not usual the documentation going ahead of the application, so my eye
interpreted the 2016.xx as 2015.xx. If not you, I would be looking 100 times
and seeing 2015.xx

canny machines zip file program can be converted to new text by editing
dimlines.scad:
- removing this line:
use <TextGenerator.scad>

- add this module:
module drawtext(string) {
	text(string);
}

Then the two included samples run.

I look at this list wistfully once in awhile, but have been sidelined 
for more than a year on another project. But today I see my website.

I had just gotten a question from someone else about the same thing and 
made some changes.

Here is an updated version of my dimlines.scad file. It uses the text() 
function with OpenSCAD now so the text is more attractive. Note that 
there is an additional feature that enables the possibility to insert 
text within dimension lines to perhaps document a variable name, should 
the need arise.

I'll at some point stick up on cannymachines.com, but here it is in the 
meantime.

Many thanks for sharing, ds.

One little remark: Line 161 should be changed from 
	color(GREY)
to
	color("GREY") 
..

Message-ID: <CAMyDR6JeHykKOK8SHbYZ3zGD82P-vjcgXYCrMA96EoKheOTtdw@mail.gmail.com>

I am learning rotate_extrude, and no matter what angle I put in, nothing
seems different at all that I can see.

What is the angle used for? And does it make a difference visibly?

This was answered by an earlier thread. The angle argument will be silently
ignored until the 2016 release. Unless you download an experimental
developers build.

sorry, didn't see/remember that earlier thread.

so, what WILL it be used for then? to stop at the angle you want (instead
of 360) of the the rotate_extrude? or is that in the earlier thread?

You can use my code, in the thread:

http://forum.openscad.org/This-seems-to-be-ultra-basic-I-cannot-have-the-rotate-extrude-angle-parameter-working-tp15180.html. 

Or maybe you may search for a more general and efficient way to do that. 

Cheers,

Subject: [OpenSCAD] need some help with polyhedron()
Message-ID: <1450364889680-15196.post@n5.nabble.com>

I've been trying to learn polyhedron() by making a cylinder the hard way and
I used Trygon's code for the spring washer to get me started (thanks
Trygon!)

The object renders fine in OpenSCAD but it looks very messed up in MeshLab.
Here are some pictures:
http://imgur.com/a/SCj2R

Is the order of points in a face important? Is the order of faces important?
I'm kind of floundering.

Here's the code:

cyl_rad=30; // outside radius 
core_rad=10; // hole radius 
height=80; // tube height
layers=20; // layers
segments=20;


function cyl(h) = let( 
    outer_points=[for(l=[0:layers-1]) for(i=[0:segments-1])
let(a=i*360/segments) [cyl_rad*cos(a), cyl_rad*sin(a), l*(h/layers)]], 
    inner_points=[for(l=[0:layers-1]) for(i=[0:segments-1])
let(a=i*360/segments) [core_rad*cos(a), core_rad*sin(a), l*(h/layers)]])
    
    [concat(outer_points, inner_points)];
    

function tops_and_bottoms() = let(
    bottoms1=[for(i=[0:segments-1]) let (j=(i+1)%segments) [i, j,
j+layers*segments]],
    bottoms2=[for(i=[0:segments-1]) let (j=(i+1)%segments) [i,
i+layers*segments, j+layers*segments]],
    tops1=[for(i=[0:segments-1]) let (j=(i+1)%segments)
[i+(layers-1)*segments, j+(layers-1)*segments,
j+layers*segments+(layers-1)*segments]],
    tops2=[for(i=[0:segments-1]) let (j=(i+1)%segments)
[i+(layers-1)*segments, i+layers*segments+(layers-1)*segments,
j+layers*segments+(layers-1)*segments]])
        
    [concat(bottoms1, bottoms2, tops1, tops2)]; 
    
function sides() = [for(l=[0:layers-2]) [for(i=[0:segments-1])
let(j=(i+1)%segments) [
        [i+l*segments, j+l*segments, j+(l+1)*segments], [i+l*segments,
i+(l+1)*segments, j+(l+1)*segments],
        [i+(l+layers)*segments, j+(l+layers)*segments,
j+(l+1+layers)*segments], [i+(l+layers)*segments, i+(l+1+layers)*segments,
j+(l+1+layers)*segments]]]];
    

function Unpack(p) = [for(i=p) for(j=i) j]; 

cyl_points=Unpack(cyl(height));

allfaces=concat(Unpack(tops_and_bottoms()), Unpack(Unpack(sides())));
 
polyhedron(cyl_points, allfaces);

The order of the faces does not matter.

Aargh! Thanks for your patience, nophead - that's the politest RTFM I think
I've ever read.

Sorry to waste everyone's time!

I should have read the manual more carefully and I would have if OpenSCAD
had flagged that something was wrong. Or if it had rendered all messed up
like MeshLab.

If you press F12 it will show the reversed faces in purple in the "Thrown
together view". Not sure why it doesn't always do that, presumably it's a
performance issue.

Hi Sebastian,

Welcome to the forum. Your post is still flagged as "This post has NOT been

need to subscribe to the  mailing list
<http://forum.openscad.org/mailing_list/MailingListOptions.jtp?forum=1>  ,
and respond to the registration email.

Import()ing multiples should be no problem.

It is possible that the stl file is non-manifold or has other issues. If you
upload it I can check it for you or you can try downloading  netfabb basic
<http://www.netfabb.com/basic.php>   or use  netfabb cloud
<https://netfabb.azurewebsites.net/>   to check it.

Hi,
You don't need to import multiple times, one is enough.
Create a module an then operate over it.
However I think the problem is not related with multiple imports.

I had no trouble.

I just put the import into a module, did some stuff to it.
and then called it multiple times.

F5 came back right away, F6 took only a few seconds.

Am using version 2015.12.02

I would interpret it slightly differently.
I.e. I woud lexpect the max of A to be one of A's entries.
I.e. echo(max(A));        // [2, 4, 5, 7] because its the one whose sum is
the max.
I.e. a max of each entry in the array A determines which entry is the max.

Likewise for max(max(A)) I would expect to see 7

So min(A) would be [1,2,3,4]
min(min(A)) would be 1

Its just convention and as nophead points out - its not defined in the
language - yet :)

@MichaelAtOz

Well, at least I would not expect it to give a false result, but a warning
and an undef.

@Neon22
actually this is, what I had expected. But in this case you run into these
problems: 

   1. the client code using min/max has to know (and parse) the structure,
which is not always granted or desireable.
   2. what will max/min do with nested Arrays of the form [.., [..., ],
...]?

So better give it a second argument with a default value. 

I came over it, because I wanted to use it for bounding box calculations of
*interpolated* extrusion data, where the size of an object is not known in
advance.

Hi,

This is a usual problem with limit situations. Maybe it is a problem with
CGAL libs, I don't know, a'm not an expert. 
I use to alter one of the parameters by a small fractional number to
compensate for that. That procedure has no significant consequences in the
final object.

But this seems to be a problem for the render procedure only if there is
something else.

A torus with a singularity is non-manifold. Although it can be constructed
and displayed, you will get problems as soon as GCAL is called to do CSG
operations on it. It aborts with this: -

ERROR: CGAL error in CGAL_Nef_polyhedron3(): CGAL ERROR: assertion
violation! Expr: e->incident_sface() != SFace_const_handle() File:

Line: 326

Which is why the union fails to give the expected result.

My very first OpenSCAD program was an attempt to make a checkerboard, and
it crashed because I created a "non-manifold object". (The bug has since
been fixed.) Here's the simplest reproduction of that bug I found:

square(10);
translate([10,10])square(10);

This program creates a "non-manifold" object. There is a singularity where
the two squares touch. However, due to some creative bug fixing, this now
renders just fine.

The torus with the singularity in the middle still doesn't render, it
seems. OpenSCAD has a general problem with models that are 3D printable,
but which are considered "non-manifold". Blame CGAL, or blame the decision
to represent 3D printable solid models as meshes. I've been playing with
non-mesh based 3D modelling software recently, which is why this is on my
mind.

You can't print 3D models that are non manifold because it is physically
impossible. Whether you get something that approximates a singularity or a
mess depends on the slicer. Better to reject non manifold constructions and
error as early as possible to avoid confusion. Since real solids are always
manifold why is there a need to model nan-manifold objects?

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Playing with code and loosing the control of the PC.
Message-ID: <1450465355292-15214.post@n5.nabble.com>


Hi,

I was playing with the code bellow to generate some "toroidal sections".  
When I was trying to figure how to open  the closed surface of one of the
"toroids" in the picture, I  blindly changed the signs of the operations in
the commented line marked with an arrow  (<==) , first line after
"difference" in module "ToroidSections".
What happen then was  chaotic. In about 30 seconds I completely loose the
control of the PC. The audio stopped, couldn't start the task manager, the
mouse was inoperative and the hard disk went crazy, using the swap area, I
suppose. For a moment I thought  that someone had taken control of my
machine remotely.  The only solution, was the power off button.  After a new
start-up, then with the task manager opened, I made a new run  to check if
it was a memory problem.  What I saw was the pc memory being consumed
exponentially in a matter of seconds, fortunately I manage to kill the
openscad process in time.

Some other times , with other codes, I've seen console warnings reporting
that the cache is not enough for the rendered modules,  but  this time no
warning was issued. 
I thing this is not good.  OpenSCAD should have a way to limit  the memory
usage. I have only 4GB in my machine + 4 GB swap . 

My OpenSCAD  ( 2015.03-2) memory settings in preferences are: 

Turn off rendering  at 100000 elements
CGAL cache size = 104857600 bytes
PolySet cache size=104857600 bytes

I think this is the the default, I don't remember to have it changed ever.

Dear developers please think in a way to avoid similar situations. OpenSCAD
is increasing its popularity and it is normal for a non experienced math guy
using it, to make some mistakes, due to the lack of enough knowledge or
comprehension of the principles behind the generation of a model.
 
Thanks.

I'm curious about the non-mesh software, can you give an example ?

I agree, silent failure, which seems to be inherent in much of OpenSCAD, is
not one of its shining features. 
It drove me nuts on occasion when I was starting to learn it.

torus(R,R) represents a perfectly real, perfectly printable object. It is
only OpenSCAD that has a problem. For example, Antimony has a torus
primitive. I just tested this: I can create torus(10,10), export it to STL,
then import it into my 3D printing software and render as G-Code. I don't
get an error at any step of the process.

A torus is an idealized mathematical object that can't be exactly
represented by a mesh. The best we can get is an approximation of a torus.
Since we are dealing with approximations anyway, there's no reason why
torus.stl, the STL approximation of 'torus(R,R)', can't be a manifold
object.

This happened to me last week, but I didn't power off the PC. I just quit
OpenSCAD then went away for an hour and waited for the PC to settle down
and stop accessing the swap.

I don't think you need such a complex program to reproduce the problem. Too
many polygons was my problem. If you set $fn=1000 then do CSG operations on
spheres, you could probably reproduce it in a few lines of code. :-)

Okay, I just tested a solution for this. Disable your swap on Windows 7. I
wrote an OpenSCAD program to consume infinite memory, and I watched the
task manager window as OpenSCAD's memory consumption kept rising. Then
Windows popped up a dialog informing me that it was low on memory and it
was killing OpenSCAD. At no point did the mouse freeze or any of those
other bad things you reported.

I have two cores on my Windows machine. The CPU never went above 50%, since
OpenSCAD can't use more than one core, so the other core was available to
run explorer, task manager, etc. Maybe that's part of the reason why my

>torus(R,R) represents a perfectly real, perfectly printable object.

No it doesn't, it has an infinitely thin singularity in the middle. You
can't print that, the best you can get is one atom thick, or no atoms but
that is a hole. I don't think it classes as 2-manifold mathematically.

When you printed it you may have got lucky and not got a slice exactly
through the singularity, or have a slicer that didn't care. It's pretty
undefined what will happen when you produce non-manifold STLs and slice
them.

Why not model it as torus(R,R - epsilon) which avoids all the problems?

Thanks Doug,

I didn't know that OpenSCAD uses only one core. My machine  have a CPU with
2 cores also. Now I have a way to keep my pc under control. There is in the
Net an useful little utility named prio.exe, when installed we can assign an
application to a core permanently.
My goal with the code I posted was not to test OpenSCAD. The situation
described happened by hazard.

Cheers,
jpmendes

Every odd behavior is bug ;-) 

module torus(R, r) {
  rotate_extrude(convexity = 4, $fn = 50)
      translate([R, 0, 0]) circle(r = r, $fn = 30);
}
//    cube(size=15, center = true);
    torus(15, 15);
this renders with F6. So torus seems to be fine as long it hasn't passed
through an operator. 

    cube(size=15, center = true);
    torus(15, 15);
this doesn't render with F6. So it seems, that the union() operator is not
working as expected. It might have a problem with the singular point [0, 0,
0] which is deleted anyway, when the cube is centered. So CGAL could check
and neclect this. Once the singularity point is part of both objects it
could decide from the second object. 

But what if the objects are not intersecting? 
    translate([50, 20, 20])
    cube(size=15, center = true);
    torus(15, 15);
guess what? 

So let's look at the translation operator: 
    translate([50, 20, 20])
    torus(15, 15);
it does no harm! But intersection(), union() and difference() do harm. So it
is the boolean operations that change the object.

Of course there are work-arounds like
    cube(size=15, center = true);
    torus(15, 14.999999999);

but this is not the point.

Hi Doug,

Setting the affinity of OpenSCAD to one processor didn't work, not even
lowering the process priority worked. The problem really is the memory swap.
If I wait enough time a window pop-pup appears requesting termination of the
application. For sure is the disk controller interrupting continuously the
CPU that causes the odd behavior. I have so little memory in my 10 year old
machine that I'm not thinking to disable the swap feature.

Thanks anyway.
jpmendes

torus(R,R - epsilon) is a torus. torus(R, R + epsilon) is topologically not
a torus, more like a disc. torus(R,R) is topologically ambiguous. It is no
wonder a program modelling 3D solids has problems with it. The only bug is
it should immediately declare torus(R,R) to be non manifold and refuse to
do anything with it, so as not to confuse people.

bug is bug. The easiest solution would be to exclude singular points [0, y]
for rotate_extrude() and throw something like "ERROR: all points for
rotate_extrude() must have same X coordinate sign and must not be singular
with X coordinate equal 0".

Have a look at this: 

> cube(10); 
> translate([-10, -10, -10]) 
> cube(10); 

This gives a warning only (as the singularity is after the union). By the
way, the warning is the behavior I would expect! 


nophead wrote
> torus(R, R + epsilon) is topologically not a torus,

Are you sure? I would say, it depends on the sign of epsilon ;-) and on the
semantics of rotate_extrude().

One could do even better and also allow for negative signs and treat
singular [0,Y] points extra. Actually I would implement it like this 
1. cut off all parts with negative X values in the sense of   square(R) }

> intersection(){shape2D(); translate([0,-R/2])cube(R) // R chosen
> suffiently large

2.  give a warning on singular [0,Y] points. (for now **no** language means
exist to express this!)

Hello everyone,

Maybe interesting to see the first printed results?
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n15228/WP_20151218_09_54_07_Pro.jpg> 


I tested the result and the sound is fine!
Only the other part, the bow, has its tone hole on the wrong place. So I
have to make a new bow.
I can improve the bow's design in the same way as the bell desig. 

Thanks for helping!
Johan

Hi,

I have 4GB and could only process the first 20000 lines.
I changed the caches sizes and render elements in OpenSCAD preferences
advanced menu by 4x.
Those modifications didn't produce any changes in the result. It aborts
always at line 20017. 
Task manager process appear to consume only about 1/10th of the memory
available.

As jp said the full list produces an error, seems to be some fixed parser
limit:

> ERROR: Parser error in line 20017: memory exhausted 
> ERROR: Compilation failed! 

I first split it in 1/2, that compiled, but rendering ran out of memory.

I then wrapped every 100 (of all 37K) in a union(), that cleared the parser
memory limit & compiled:
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n15231/td15226_F5.jpg> 

mmm...chips...

Rendering now, will take a while to find out if it hits my memory limit.

This is hard to diagnose without source.

It might be a syntax error that is silently gobbling up the rest of the
file? Or a bug in Openscad, in which case I have no clue.

The source link is in the first post which did not make
it to the mailing list.

@JBoehm: If you already have the triangulated surface, it
would be much much more efficient to just put that into a
single polyhedron.
Trying to union 37000 polyhedrons might be a test what is
faster: CGAL union or the sun burning up all it's mass.

Instead of extruding every triangle along its normal, can you calculate the
normal at each point? Moving the points along their normals, then building
polyhedrons out of that would at least avoid the "dry lake bed" look.  

But also as Torsten was saying, if you could do it all as a single
polyhedron it would be best. The triangles on the surfaces could be
calculated as above, moving points along normals, then all you need is to
know which vertices make up the "edge" of the entire surface, and make a
triangle strip along the edge between the top and bottom surfaces to close
out the polyhedron.  Also at that point it might be just as simple to export
it as STL directly, its a very basic format and very similar to the
polyhedron module.

This is the point. A surface looking like that, is not the manifold you'd
want to render. At least you should provide data where common points of
adjacent triangles are identical (your data has numerical errors).
Addionally it is advisable to separate upper and lower points and provide a
sorted index for upper and lower border point pairs. Knitting this into a
top side, a bottom side and a border side from this data is easy. 
If this is not possible a viable approach would be to write code that
analyses your data and produces a representation like this. 


> upper_points =[[x1, y1, z1], ... ]; 
> lower_points =[[x1, y1, z1], ... ]; 
> upper_triags = [[n1, n2, n3], ...]; 
> lower_triags = [[n1, n2, n3], ...]; 
> border_points=[[upper1,lower2] ...];   // sorted

Ok, I tried wrapping all the calls to rendertri in a union, and it processes
all then crashes. 
Still no real memory consumption. 

Small surgery in notepad to create two unions for the calls to rendertri,
roughly 50/50.
With two unions, I can preview.   I don't grok why unions are working here,
I wouldn't expect that, but ok..

What I got in preview was a disc shape, looked like some curves in the disc.
I don't know what I should see, so maybe the unions broke something.

If you have 8 cores, you are maxing out one of the cores at 12%, and 
OpenSCAD cannot use the other cores.  So maybe it is running flat out.

empty. Just picking the correct phrase is a challenge, I've found.

It's been decades since I've had any real exposure to coding. Even though
this portion of code works, I feel it's inelegant.



Is there a simple, cleaner way to generate translations in opposite
directions along one axis? This particular project will expand incrementally
upward as well as along the x and y axes, generating a hexagonal conic shape
of sorts

I'm going to make a guess that vector loops (?) would be a better choice,
but I understand that even less than this simple stuff.

thanks

fred

One option would be to use a module that generates both the x and -x
child module:

$fn=120;
high=1;
dia=1.25;

module mirrored_translate(x) {
  translate([x, 0, 0]) children();
  if (x > 0.001) translate([-x, 0, 0]) children();
}

for (i=[0:1:5])
  mirrored_translate(i*1.25)
    cylinder(high,d=dia);


Note that your code generated 2 identical overlapping cylinders at
the center which can cause issues later on.

ciao,
  Torsten.

or simply, without using the module, (although that is coolness), just put
braces around what you want in your for loop (to form a block), as in:

for (i=[0:1:5]) {
  translate([i*(1.25), 0, 0])
    cylinder(high,d=dia);
  translate([-(i*1.25), 0, 0])
    cylinder(high,d=dia);
}

I think the braces might be the answer I seek, although I agree that the
module method is elegant. The braces method does not remove the duplicate
central cylinder, although this is not a print project, it could become one,
and the duplicate should be avoided.

I've run into a problem with the module method though. I don't understand
clearly the concept of children() in this context. Well, I don't understand
the concept within programming in general, so within OpenSCAD it gets more
challenging.

I did a search of the wiki page and did not get clarification enough to
understand this simple code segment. This is not a good sign.

My next segment will be to create another row of cylinders offset to the +/-
direction, cylinder count minus one and offset the appropriate distance x to
create tangent contact. I'd prefer to understand the code prior to expanding
this effort.

To complicate matters, eventually the central cylinder will be z'd up while
the outermost ring will be z=0 and the intermediate cylinders will be, well,
intermediate height.

I think I'm going about this in an incorrect manner and perhaps should thing
from the center outward, rather than striping the cylinders, causing coding
problems later.

Try to forget programming for a bit :-). Just think real
objects and lets define recipes how to create those...

So we have a red cube of size 10 - in OpenSCAD that's:

  color("red") cube(10, center = true);

Now we introduce modules which are basically just a shortcut
for what's inside:

  module red_cube() {
    color("red") cube(10, center = true);
  }

  red_cube();

We simply gave the recipe to produce a red cube a special name
using the module definition which by itself does nothing. But
we do can use the "red_cube()" now which creates the object we
defined in that recipe.

Then there's modules that can affect other things, for example
translate() which moves it's child objects.

  translate([20, 20, 0]) red_cube();

Simply moving that into a module, for example with a single
parameter for the x part of the translation gives a recipe
for a red_cube() that can be moved in x direction using the
x parameter for the recipe (so we have to give that parameter
when using the recipe):

  module my_translate(x) {
    translate([x, 20, 0]) red_cube();
  }

  my_translate(x = 20);

Now using the special children() module we can substitute the
object that is translated and leave that for later, similar to
the built-in translate(). Effectively that children() will be
now replaced with whatever is written after the actual use of
my_translate() - e.g. once the red_cube() and once a "normal"
cube().
So basically we leave the part that describes the translation
in the my_translate() module but don't force it to be applied
only to red_cube(). Now it can be applied to any child object.

  module my_translate(x) {
    translate([x, 20, 0]) children();
  }

  my_translate(x = 20) red_cube();
  my_translate(x = -20) sphere(5);

That hit my limit of 8GB (4GB+4GB swap).

It (the 100 union'ed version) has been running for 1/2 a day on my bigger
box. (8 core 3.5GHz 16BG+swap raid SSD)
Just checked it this AM, unfortunately it went to sleep at some time...
It is about to hit commit of 7GB, at this stage the peak working set is
5.3GB and current WS <2GB.

OpenSCAD is single threaded and does not use GPU either.
So best is the highest GHz CPU and plenty of memory.

If the arguments to a CSG operation like union are so large they don't fit
in primary cache, then I'd expect cache thrashing, and a big slowdown as
the CPU will be waiting on main memory.

The CPU is idle because it's continually waiting for the disk because its
thrashing and needs more memory. OpenSCAD is built upon libraries that are
open and very powerful but unfortunately neither stunningly fast nor
memory efficient, especially as OpenSCAD uses them. The algorithms used
are also memory and performance dependant upon the number of vertices
involved.

Your test compile triggers those cases quite spectacularly, it rapidly
needs lots of memory and the moment it exceeds your RAM your are waiting
for disk all the time, which is very very slow relative to CPU
performance.

If you had a real world need for such a complex object you'd want to use
different tools whose algorithms are instead strongly time dependant upon
the detail level of the final render. ImplicitCAD should for example
handle it fairly well.

It's not a normal use case for 3D printing, so while OpenSCAD has some
speed annoyances they usually don't bite you for real world work.

Message-ID: <1450702628866-15260.post@n5.nabble.com>

I like to have a handwritten logo in my 3D printed objects.
With surface it is possible to convert a png file into a 3D logo that you
can add or substract from flat surfaces. But I liked to have to logo on a
curved object.
So I made a curved logo in this way:

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n15260/democurvedlogo.png> 

The code is as follows:
//------------------------------------------------
// module to make a curved logo from a png file
//------------------------------------------------


curvedlogo(20,20);


module curvedlogo(diameter,lenght)
{
    
    $fn=60;
    
    translate([0,0,-diameter/2])
    intersection()
        {
            // create a tube with 2* lenght and diameter
            difference()
            {
                rotate(90,[1,0,0]) 
                  translate([0,0,-lenght]) 
                   
cylinder(lenght*2,diameter/2+4,diameter/2+4,center=false);
                rotate(90,[1,0,0]) 
                    translate([0,0,-lenght-0.1]) 
                       
cylinder(lenght*2+0.2,diameter/2,diameter/2,center=false);
            }
            // create a 3D logo with height diameter*2
            translate([0,0,diameter]) 
            resize([lenght, lenght, diameter]) 
            surface(file = "logob.png", center = true, invert=true,
convexity = 5);

       
    }

}

Good approach! If there was a function importing data into a matrix, one
could do really crazy things!

surface() tends to be very slow.
A better approach would be to trace the png into a vector outline.

We?re working on such a built-in function, see here: https://github.com/openscad/openscad/pull/1110

There are also external tools for this:

That right it is very slow. It helped when I reduced the complexity of the
logo and first made and slt file of the logo, simplified it using Meshlab
and then import it.

Here is the result:

I checked stack exchange about how %cpu usage is calculated. I don't think
my guess about CPU cache thrashing is correct.

Alan notes that the CPU won't be at 100% if the swap is thrashing. That
can't explain David's result where OpenScad is consuming 20Gb of a total
64Gb RAM.

Running a profiling tool on openscad might reveal the cause.

If its performance is bound by disk seek-latency, wouldn't an SSD (a.k.a.
"flash drive") improve performance considerably? They're getting cheap these
days...

Not a lot. An SSD has much better latency but the difference between RAM
and even a top end SSD is several orders of magnitude (think information
on your desk versus having to go into another room on a different floor to
get it. In fact in most cases think versus having to get into the car and
drive somewhere ot get it).

More RAM will help if the model will fit better. What actually matters is
what is called the "working set" - which is the pieces of information
needed a lot. That's often smaller than the full memory needed - which is
why swap works at all.

I use 16GB with OpenSCAD and the box was purposely chosen so I could
shove 16GB of RAM into it as some of my models are quite complex. I still
have a few models that OpenSCAD can't do a good job on, for those I use
other tools. For the rest OpenSCAD has the nice UI and is just easier to
work with.

Interesting. FWIW, here are some figures of merit for seek latencies:
HDD is about 10ms
SDD is about .1ms
RAM (not cache) is about .0001ms

If the workload is disk latency bound, a 100x improvement going from HDD to
SSD might help a lot (though clearly not as much as the 100,000x jump going
to RAM).

Maybe the CPU has chip envy. Har har har.

Basically swapping on Windows doesn't work. It always brings the system to
its knees. You need to have enough physical memory for all the programs or
it becomes un-responsive for long periods. While it can schedule the CPU
and share it between processes it seems unable to share the disk and the
driver seems able to lock out everything else while shovelling 100's of
megabytes in and out of the swap space.

Looks good. Another approach is to use Inkscape and its tools, to vectorise
your bitmap, and then export to openSCAD using a special extension.
- in inkscape the tool is under the Path menu and is called "Trace bitmap".
   (POTrace does the work and its code is avilable for other projects to
include).
- The Extension is under "Generate from Paths" / "Paths to openSCAD".
- you need to install the Inkscape extension from here:

My observation is that as the page fault interrupts get served before
anything else, when you have a chronically growing memory gobbler it starts
to bottleneck on the page file, which also gets high I/O priority, thus
delaying other I/O, such as system logs etc, thus clogging up everything.

Prior to getting a SSD this would cripple my system to the extent that the
mouse would lag and even a Ctrl-Alt-Del would take many seconds to get
handled.

Now with a SSD it is manageable.

I've collected the resources you've provided and am going to have to ponder for a while, experiment and attempt to understand clearly the mechanics of the children() feature. Would it be practical to create a short bit of code in "longhand" that represents what the children() feature performs? I'm nearing the end of my 60th year, having started my life in my zero-th year, so the brain cells don't function well later in the day. If the earlier part of the day involves strenuous activity, the brain cells are also kaput for the day.

Try to forget programming for a bit :-). Just think real
objects and lets define recipes how to create those...

So we have a red cube of size 10 - in OpenSCAD that's:

? color("red") cube(10, center = true);

Now we introduce modules which are basically just a shortcut
for what's inside:

? module red_cube() {
? ? color("red") cube(10, center = true);
? }

? red_cube();

We simply gave the recipe to produce a red cube a special name
using the module definition which by itself does nothing. But
we do can use the "red_cube()" now which creates the object we
defined in that recipe.

Then there's modules that can affect other things, for example
translate() which moves it's child objects.

? translate([20, 20, 0]) red_cube();

Simply moving that into a module, for example with a single
parameter for the x part of the translation gives a recipe
for a red_cube() that can be moved in x direction using the
x parameter for the recipe (so we have to give that parameter
when using the recipe):

? module my_translate(x) {
? ? translate([x, 20, 0]) red_cube();
? }

? my_translate(x = 20);

Now using the special children() module we can substitute the
object that is translated and leave that for later, similar to
the built-in translate(). Effectively that children() will be
now replaced with whatever is written after the actual use of
my_translate() - e.g. once the red_cube() and once a "normal"
cube().
So basically we leave the part that describes the translation
in the my_translate() module but don't force it to be applied
only to red_cube(). Now it can be applied to any child object.

? module my_translate(x) {
? ? translate([x, 20, 0]) children();
? }

? my_translate(x = 20) red_cube();
? my_translate(x = -20) sphere(5);

Some more examples:

There isn't a long hand version of children(), you simple can't do what it
does any other way. The children of a module are the modules below it in
the tree. For example the children of translate are the things you place
after it that you want translated. The children() module gets replaced by
all the children of the module it is contained in. For example:

module rotate90() {
    rotate([0, 0, 90])
       children();
}

rotate90()
   cube([1,10,1]);


Becomes: -

rotate([0, 0, 90])
    cube([1, 10, 1]);

In this case there is only one child but if you enclose several things in
braces you can have multiple children() and you can use children(0) to
refer to the first one, children(1) the second and so on.

The latest reply has been helpful. I'd like to see an example with more than
one object to the children() aspect, if that's the correct terminology. I
think I have a couple examples provided earlier, so I'll read those over
too.

I'm not sure yet when I'll make use of this feature. I hope when it is
needed, it "jumps out" at me and is recognized as such.

Thank you

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n15275/arrayoscad.png> 
This has been simple so far, but I've run out of math skills.

In the image below, the cylinders crossed by the radial lines are generated
by the code above. Each segment can be considered a ring of cylinders, but
not as easily calculated as the radial cylinders. As an example, the blue
cylinders on ring 2 (0,1,2) are tangent to the pair on ring one. The centers
of these six are on a circle with the center at the origin.
Ring 3 has a pair at each section, but also a common circle/center/origin.
Rings 4 and 5 have two separate circle/center/origin references.

I did a Google search to discover if there was the equivalent of the AutoCAD
command circle, tangent, tangent, radius but came up empty in that respect.

I'd like to build code that would allow any (reasonable) number of rings and
fill in the missing cylinders in an accurate manner. I would also expect
that as the ring number becomes greater, there would be an increase in the
number of unique circle/center/origin relationships as well. I believe that
I could generate some arbitrary numbers and adjust them until the design
requirements are met, but I'd very much prefer to have a formula as a base
for the fill in cylinders.

The future code will include a z-translate specific to the ring number, but
I expect that's going to be as simple as it sounds.

Any ideas?

sounds simple. Put any number for n!

board(); 

module board(r=10, n=5, h=1)
{
  cylinder(h=h, r=r); 
  for(k=[0:60:359])
    rotate([0, 0, k])
    for(i=[1:n])
      for(j=[0:n-i])
        translate([j*r+2*r*i, j*sqrt(3)*r, 0])
        cylinder(h=h, r=r); 
}

that's pretty impressive for such a tiny bit of code. The results are almost
spot-on for my project.

I changed the translate z to j*2, the 2 being an arbitrary value, and it
"elevated" the wrong items.

What's the easiest way to translate z for each ring in turn? That is, the
center cylinder would remain in place (or not) while the first six outward
would be affected by the associated value, then the next twelve, and so on.

thehans, that was it! I added a fourth parameter to the module (step) and
used (i+j)*-step in the code to get a downward increment. It's beautiful!

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n15279/array.png> 

The next segment of code is yet tricky for me, as I have not attempted to
understand how the just-completed section works.

Another set of cylinders with the same centers as the previous code, but
smaller diameter (r-value) and stepped the same amount, then "subtracted"
from the main body. I suspect that this may be an example of where
children() would be used.

Anyone please do not provide the raw code for this, as I'd like to exercise
the brain cells and determine how the previous code does what it does, to
see if this is the correct route.

A confirmation or refutation that children() is the right direction would be
helpful, or any other general suggestions.

thanks
fred

I need advice on how to model an hyperbola (i.e., z=xy). There's no primitive

In case it matters, my goal is to intersect it with a sphere to cut the

This depends somewhat on what kind of resolution you need.
You can stitch together a polyhedron from scratch.
Or you use the easy to understand, but slow chain-hull method.

Here is an example for a one dimensional case: z=x*x.
Generalize it to two dimensions and your good to go.
Just limit the $fn of the spheres to small numbers.


?

for (i=[-10:10-1]){
    hull(){
        s(i);
        s(i+1);
        t(i);
        t(i+1);
    }
}


module s(i){
    translate([i,0,0.1*i*i])sphere(r=1,$fn=8);

}module t(i){
    translate([i,0,0])sphere(r=1,$fn=8);
}

Or have a look at thingiverse.

This seems to be written before the list comprehension features
were available so it uses a union of lots of small polyhedrons
which will make it quite slow at higher resolutions.

The 3d-function.scad might be able to generate a similar 3d-plot
too as single polyhedron:

It isn't the right shape though, unless I misunderstand the original
question. A rotated hyperbola is not the same as a 3D hyperbola z = x * y.

It looks like this: -


Here is the code I used to make it:
xmin = 0;
xmax = 1;
ymin = 0;
ymax = 1;
step = 0.05;

xpoints = floor((xmax - xmin) / step) + 1;
ypoints = floor((ymax - ymin) / step) + 1;
function index(x,y) = x * ypoints + y + 1;
function x(i) = xmin + i * step;
function y(i) = ymin + i * step;

points = concat([[x(xpoints - 1), y(ypoints - 1), 0]],
         [for(i = [0 : xpoints - 1]) for(j = [0 : ypoints - 1]) [x(i),
y(j), x(i) * y(j)]]);

function flatten(l) = [for(a = l) for (b = a) b];

base = [[0, 1, index(xpoints -1, 0)],
        [1, 0, index(0, ypoints -1)],
        [0, index(xpoints - 1, ypoints - 1), index(0, ypoints - 1)],
        [0, index(xpoints - 1, 0), index(xpoints - 1, ypoints - 1)],
       ];

faces = flatten([for(i = [0 : xpoints - 2]) for(j = [0 : ypoints - 2])
         [[index(i,j), index(i, j + 1), index(i + 1, j + 1)],
          [index(i + 1, j + 1), index(i + 1, j ), index(i, j)]]
        ]);

polyhedron(points, concat(base, faces));


?

Exactly right, nophead: a rotated 2D hyperbola != a 3D hyperbola. 

Thanks for the code! I need the actual saddle area and when I put in -1 for
the minimum x and y values (instead of 0), it kind of "self-intersects"
through the origin as it ties the faces to [1,1,0] and [-1,-1,1].

I suppose I could whack "points = concat([[x(xpoints - 1), y(ypoints - 1),
0]], ..." and change the 0 to like -5 or something but it worries me that I
don't understand the code well enough to cover this case properly.  Can you
show me the correct way?

That is actually simpler as it can be closed by two triangles.


?xmin = -1;
xmax = 1;
ymin = -1;
ymax = 1;
step = 0.05;

xpoints = floor((xmax - xmin) / step) + 1;
ypoints = floor((ymax - ymin) / step) + 1;
function index(x,y) = x * ypoints + y;
function x(i) = xmin + i * step;
function y(i) = ymin + i * step;

points = [for(i = [0 : xpoints - 1]) for(j = [0 : ypoints - 1]) [x(i),
y(j), x(i) * y(j)]];

function flatten(l) = [for(a = l) for (b = a) b];

base = [
        [index(0, 0), index(xpoints -1, 0), index(0, ypoints -1)],
        [index(xpoints -1, ypoints -1), index(0, ypoints -1), index(xpoints
-1, 0)],
       ];

faces = flatten([for(i = [0 : xpoints - 2]) for(j = [0 : ypoints - 2])
         [[index(i,j), index(i, j + 1), index(i + 1, j + 1)],
          [index(i + 1, j + 1), index(i + 1, j ), index(i, j)]]
        ]);

polyhedron(points, concat(base, faces));

That's exactly what I needed. Thank you!

Cutting a sphere with it throws an exception for some reason. This code:

difference() {
    sphere(r=.5, $fn=20);
    polyhedron(points, concat(base, faces));
}

generates this error:

ERROR: CGAL error in CGAL_Nef_polyhedron3(): CGAL ERROR: assertion
violation! Expr: e->incident_sface() != SFace_const_handle() File:
/data/OpenSCAD/libraries-mingw32-master/mxe/usr/i686-w64-mingw32.static/include/CGAL/Nef_S2/SM_const_decorator.h
Line: 326 

Suggestions?

It is because I closed the faces with single triangles creating lots of t
junctions where the small triangles meet. It needs to be closed with
triangle fans, my mistake.

Here is one that works: -

xpoints = floor((xmax - xmin) / step) + 1;

function index(x,y) = x * ypoints + y + 2;
function x(i) = xmin + i * step;
function y(i) = ymin + i * step;

points = concat([[xmin, ymin, zmin]],
                [[xmax, ymax, zmin]],
         [for(i = [0 : xpoints - 1]) for(j = [0 : ypoints - 1]) [x(i),
y(j), x(i) * y(j)]]);

function flatten(l) = [for(a = l) for (b = a) b];

base = [
        [1, 0, index(xpoints -1, 0)],
        [0, 1, index(0, ypoints -1)],
        flatten([for(i = [0 : xpoints - 2]) [0, index(i, 0), index(i +
1,0)]]),
        flatten([for(j = [0 : ypoints - 2]) [0, index(0, j), index(0, j +
1)]]),
        flatten([for(i = [0 : xpoints - 2]) [1, index(i + 1, ypoints - 1),
index(i, ypoints - 1)]]),
        flatten([for(j = [0 : ypoints - 2]) [1, index(xpoints - 1, j),
index(xpoints - 1, j + 1)]]),
       ];

faces = flatten([for(i = [0 : xpoints - 2]) for(j = [0 : ypoints - 2])
         [[index(i,j), index(i, j + 1), index(i + 1, j + 1)],
          [index(i + 1, j + 1), index(i + 1, j ), index(i, j)]]
        ]);


difference() {
    sphere(r=.5, $fn=20);
    polyhedron(points, concat(base, faces), convexity = 2);
}

Actually it still doesn't work. I found one bug but I am stuck now. The
error as gone away but it still doesn't render:

xmin = -1;
xmax = 1;

zmin = min(xmin *ymax, xmax * ymin);

xpoints = floor((xmax - xmin) / step) + 1;
ypoints = floor((ymax - ymin) / step) + 1;
function index(x,y) = x * ypoints + y + 2;
function x(i) = xmin + i * step;
function y(i) = ymin + i * step;

points = concat([[xmin, ymin, zmin]],
                [[xmax, ymax, zmin]],
         [for(i = [0 : xpoints - 1]) for(j = [0 : ypoints - 1]) [x(i),
y(j), x(i) * y(j)]]);

function flatten(l) = [for(a = l) for (b = a) b];

base = [
        [1, 0, index(xpoints -1, 0)],
        [0, 1, index(0, ypoints -1)],
        flatten([for(i = [0 : xpoints - 2]) [0, index(i, 0), index(i + 1,

        flatten([for(j = [0 : ypoints - 2]) [0, index(0, j + 1), index(0,

        flatten([for(i = [0 : xpoints - 2]) [1, index(i + 1, ypoints - 1),
index(i, ypoints - 1)]]),
        flatten([for(j = [0 : ypoints - 2]) [1, index(xpoints - 1, j),

In fact the error is still there when I flush the caches.

hi,

Welcome to the forum. Your post is still flagged as "This post has NOT been
accepted by the mailing list yet", so nobody gets it unless they look. You
need to subscribe to the  mailing list
<http://forum.openscad.org/mailing_list/MailingListOptions.jtp?forum=1>  ,
and respond to the registration email.

This should get you started, note it is good to overlap things you join by a
small amount and similarly, if you difference() something you want them not
to have the same face, hence the translate([0,0,-small]), so it punches
through the bottom. (look at it without that too see).

small=0.01;
difference() { 
	union() {
		cylinder(h = 6, r1 = 7, r2 = 7); 
		translate([0, 0, 6-small]) cylinder(h = 7.8+small, r = 8.5); 
		translate([0, 0, 13.8-small]) cylinder(h = 12.5, r1 = 9.7, r2 = 9.1); 
	}
	// - 
	translate([0,0,-small]) cylinder(27.3, r = 5); 
}

Not sure you got my last message.  Thanks for the quick-turn on it!
So now I need to add a taper to it, and I get the overlap so it's not
printed in 3 sections, which would defeat the purpose of it being printed as
a piece.
How do I scale it to be in milimeters?  This is a whole new world for me,
but it's hard for me, because I'm not a math person.  This is where I pay
for not being any good at math.

This stuff is way over my head but FWIW, this code:

intersection() {
    polyhedron(points, concat(base, faces), convexity = 2);
    sphere(r=.5, $fn=80);
}

generates a preview of a zero-thickness contour (that looks like a potato
chip). That is, the intersection() shows only where the *surface* of the
polyhedron intersects with the volume of the sphere and excludes all the
volume that the two objects share.

Maybe that is useful to know.

For some reason GCAL doesn't like my polyhedron but I can't see why. I can
export it to an STL and it looks fine in netfabb as well.

I just changed the threshold to zero (ie do not break digest into issues by
size). It also has a send daily option which is set. So that should make it
daily.

If anyone has issues with large Digests that let me know.

1. If I change for(i = [0 : xpoints - 1])
   to for(i = [0 : xpoints - 0])
   I see no visual change.

2. Also when I F6 the object I get a result but its not using the color
scheme I've chosen. 
    I think this means there is something wrong with the model.

3. If I reverse the difference:
difference() {
	polyhedron(points, concat(base, faces), convexity = 2);
	sphere(r=.5, $fn=45); 
} 
  I get a CGAL error - coincident face.
ERROR: CGAL error in CGAL_Nef_polyhedron3(): CGAL ERROR: assertion
violation! Expr: e->incident_sface() != SFace_const_handle() File:

Line: 326 

Looks like one of the indices is off in base=... ??maybe??
still looking

OpenSCAD is unit-less. It is the slicing software that translates unit-less
measurements into the units of the printer. Most (?) operate in metric mm.
So if you just use r=5 than will be a circle of 10mm.

Re taper, that will be fiddly to get such a smooth flat-j curve to that
section. An approximation is possible like so: (I just guested at 8mm along
for the skinny part)

$fn=64;
small=0.01;
difference() {
        union() {
                cylinder(h = 6, r1 = 7, r2 = 7);
                translate([0, 0, 6-small]) cylinder(h = 7.8+small, r = 8.5);
		// approximate taper
                translate([0, 0, 13.8-small]) cylinder(h = 8+small, r = 9.7,
r2=9.1); // was h=12.
		translate([0, 0, 13.8+8-small]) cylinder(h=1+small, r = 9.1);
		translate([0, 0, 13.8+8+1-small]) cylinder(h=4+small, r= 9.1, r2=9.7);
        }
        // -
        translate([0,0,-small]) cylinder(27.3, r = 5);
} 
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n15306/n15299_fountain_pen_taper.jpg> 
I hope you have a very good quality printer, in my experience such small
things don't come out so good.

ah,... you are the guy with the potatoe chip. 

Sorry, got your specification wrong. 
- calc points of upper and lower surface
- calc triangles of upper and lower surface
- calc triangles of border 

Good idea to cut the square plot with a sphere!

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n15307/showcase13.png> 

I guess this is your code:

and having fun with thickness of chip :)
N = 40;
thick = 1;
sphere_res = 100;

range = [for (i=[0:N-1]) -1+i*2/(N-1)];

upper = point_function(range, thick);  // upper face
lower = point_function(range, 0);   // lower face

Faces = concat(
    triangles(N, upper),
    triangles(N, lower, true),
    triangles_border(N));

Points = concat(upper, lower);

intersection()
{
  translate([0,0,thick/2])
	sphere(1, $fn = sphere_res);
  polyhedron(faces = Faces, points = Points, convexity=3);
}

.. and the rest
gives

Wow, I'm really, really new at this stuff. ?Thanks a million for the help. ?Is there a way to import this into a different CAD to mess with?But you make it look so easy.I have a FlashForge Dreamer, it is supposed to have a decent resolution for it. ?Haven't printed with it yet, because Santa Claus hasn't officially delivered it. ?But it's here.I have it also listed on Thingiverse and there's been some help on there with it. ?Yes, the next step as I understand is slicing. ?What does that do? ?Is that the final look and then you save it as a g file or something.
I really need adult supervision on this! ?This is what happens when you let people with liberal arts degrees gain access to technology. ?It just slows everyone else down.

I spent a little time refactoring and simplifying the 3d-function.scad
example today. Attached is my version of "The Pringles Code".

Agh, there is a weird bug where it seems that opening other OpenSCAD
instances from other directiories causes subsequent saves to go to the
wrong directory.  Sorry, kept getting the wrong save of this file since I
was grabbing from my original save path.

LOL. Actually, I'm not the potato chip guy - I'm just trying to cut a sphere
in half with an hyperbola and getting a potato chip instead.

Hopefully the true Potato Chip Guy is reading this thread though!

Here is a version that finally works.


?
xmin = -1;
xmax = 1;
ymin = -1;
ymax = 1;
step = 0.05;
zmin = min(xmin *ymax, xmax * ymin);

xpoints = floor((xmax - xmin) / step) + 1;
ypoints = floor((ymax - ymin) / step) + 1;
function index(x,y) = x * ypoints + y + 2;
function x(i) = xmin + i * step;
function y(i) = ymin + i * step;

points = concat([[xmin, ymin, zmin]],
                [[xmax, ymax, zmin]],
         [for(i = [0 : xpoints - 1]) for(j = [0 : ypoints - 1]) [x(i),
y(j), x(i) * y(j)]]);

function flatten(l) = [for(a = l) for (b = a) b];

base = concat(
        [[1, 0, index(xpoints - 1, 0)]],
        [[0, 1, index(0, ypoints - 1)]],
        [for(i = [0 : xpoints - 2]) [0, index(i, 0), index(i + 1, 0)]],
        [for(j = [0 : ypoints - 2]) [0, index(0, j + 1), index(0, j)]],
        [for(i = [0 : xpoints - 2]) [1, index(i + 1, ypoints - 1), index(i,
ypoints - 1)]],
        [for(j = [0 : ypoints - 2]) [1, index(xpoints - 1, j),
index(xpoints - 1, j + 1)]]
       );

faces = flatten([for(i = [0 : xpoints - 2]) for(j = [0 : ypoints - 2])
         [[index(i,j), index(i, j + 1), index(i + 1, j + 1)],
          [index(i + 1, j + 1), index(i + 1, j ), index(i, j)]]
        ]);

difference() {
     sphere(r= 0.5, $fn=80);
     polyhedron(points, concat(base, faces), convexity = 2);
}
?

My stupid mistake was flattening the base list when it didn't need to be.
The result was some faces with multiple triangles instead of single
triangle per face. Looks like cgal can't handle that but the rest of the
system can. The STL file it exported was correct..

Nice shape.  I just installed more RAM in my PC so fancy doing a minkowski sum of that with a sphere.  The room I?m working in needs warming up? J

@laakman,  You can export as an stl or obj - which turns the object into a
polygonal approximation. These two file formats are the most commonly read.
OBJ is probably the most common but 3D printer slicers usually prefer STL
files. CAD editors usually keep the files in solids form but you probably
want a polygonal editor to do further work and not a CAD based editor. YMMV.

Then you could edit it further in all kinds of polygonal editing programs.
(such as Blender, Wings3D, very large number of these).
Then re-export as an STL to send to the slicing program associated with your
printer.
I use Repetier - which uses Slic3r(default) or Cura or Skeinforge as the
slicing engines.
These generate gcode which controls the actual printer by making it move in
lines and arcs while extruding (occasionally).
There are several variants of g-code - different machines support different
sets of codes but there is a common set which works pretty well across the
board.
All slicers have to be setup for specific sized XYZ ranges, speeds, rates
etc.
Your printer will have this info and a preferred slicer. Start with that
until you're really comfortable to change it completely.... as usual YMMV

Argh ... sorry again. The problem looked so similar. That made me think you
could be the same guy using different names. Maybe you are visiting the same
class? ;-) 

By the way, you get both solutions by altering just one number!

// upper = point_function(range, .1);  // upper face
upper = point_function(range, 2);  // upper face

Looks nice.  So?I tried to copy it to play with it (and understand it).

I get:   

ERROR: Parser error in line 38: syntax error
ERROR: Conmpilation failed!

Presumably, that?s because I?m behind on my updates.
What version do I need, please?

Simply cut and paste it from the email. There is no line 38, so I think you
cut one too many lines.

Here is a slightly simpler version without the use of flatten plus a few
comments: -

xmin = -1;
xmax = 1;
ymin = -1;
ymax = 1;
step = 0.05;
zmin = min(xmin * ymax, xmax * ymin);

xpoints = floor((xmax - xmin) / step) + 1;
ypoints = floor((ymax - ymin) / step) + 1;
function index(x,y) = x * ypoints + y + 2; // plus 2 because of two extra
points added to make the base
function x(i) = xmin + i * step;
function y(i) = ymin + i * step;

points = concat([[xmin, ymin, zmin]], // two extra points to allow a
rectangular base
                [[xmax, ymax, zmin]],
                [for(i = [0 : xpoints - 1], j = [0 : ypoints - 1]) [x(i),
y(j), x(i) * y(j)]]);

base = concat(
        [[1, 0, index(xpoints - 1, 0)]], // two triangles to make the base
        [[0, 1, index(0, ypoints - 1)]],
        // four triangule fans for the sides
        [for(i = [0 : xpoints - 2]) [0, index(i, 0), index(i + 1, 0)]],
        [for(i = [0 : xpoints - 2]) [1, index(i + 1, ypoints - 1), index(i,
ypoints - 1)]],
        [for(j = [0 : ypoints - 2]) [0, index(0, j + 1), index(0, j)]],
        [for(j = [0 : ypoints - 2]) [1, index(xpoints - 1, j),
index(xpoints - 1, j + 1)]]
       );

faces = concat( // connect every four points with two triangles
        [for(i = [0 : xpoints - 2], j = [0 : ypoints - 2]) [index(i,j),
index(i, j + 1), index(i + 1, j + 1)]],
        [for(i = [0 : xpoints - 2], j = [0 : ypoints - 2]) [index(i + 1, j
+ 1), index(i + 1, j ), index(i, j)]]
        );

difference() {
     sphere(r= 0.5, $fn=80);
     polyhedron(points, concat(base, faces), convexity = 2);
}

Message-ID: <CAEEmnrPkhwWK9K5AwOY8JfNkyDr6peGOkw=2Z6iZS07PiyVyVA@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a reason why list comprehensions can't have a comma separated list
of elements after the for(..) instead of the just a single element? That
would eliminate the need for flatten in some cases.

This proposed extension is also part of the OpenSCAD2 proposal. So I agree.

If I unterstand your question well, there is a good work-around for this. Use
a second loop variable within your loop and enumerate your vector with it: 

echo([for(i=[0:10], j=[0:1])  let (a= [i, i*i]) a[j]]);

Thanks.  There was <white-space> at the end.  I removed it and all is well.

So, now the question is: why is <white-space> a syntax error?

Perhaps not an important question - but it is puzzling (to me).

Yes that is a good trick but a comma would be much simpler.

White space isn't a syntax error, perhaps it contained an invisible control
character or something.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] issue with difference function
Message-ID: <1450991275209-15327.post@n5.nabble.com>

I am having an issue with the difference function.  I created a polygon shape
and linear_extrude and put a hole in each end.  The hole does not show when
I turn debug off.  The first image shows with debug on.  The second image
has debug off.  With the third image I move the hole up just to show how far
it actually goes into the shape.  Any idea why the hole would not show with
debug off?

Perhaps you have not set convexity appropriately in the linear_extrude, but
that is just a guess without seeing the code.

The only parameter I pass to linear_extrude is height.

This is the code that draws the shape.


module draw_vee_side(degrees, rows=4, part_width, height=part_height) {
	difference() {
		union() {
			linear_extrude(height=height)
				polygon(points=[
					[0, 0],
					[part_width, vh],
					[part_width, vh+(rows*lane_width)],
					[0, (rows*lane_width)]		
				], paths=[[0, 1, 2, 3]]);
		}
		
		union() {
			// Pin Holes		
			for (pin=[0:rows-1]) {
		        translate([-part_width-(pin_depth),
vh+(lane_width*pin)+(lane_width_half), height/2])
		            rotate([0, 90, 0])
		            	draw_pin_hole();
			}
		}
	}
}


module draw_vee(degrees=45, rows=4, part_width=i2m(1.5), rows=4, pegs=5,
height=part_height) {
	draw_vee_side(degrees, rows, part_width, height);
	
	mirror([1,0,0]) 
		draw_vee_side(degrees, rows, part_width, height);
}


draw_vee();

I think that's relatively simple to add. I've created a patch
that allows multiple comma separated expressions and seems
to pass all the existing tests.

function f(x) = x*x*x;
echo([for (a = [1:2:10]) a, a*a, f(a)]);
// ECHO: [1, 1, 1, 3, 9, 27, 5, 25, 125, 7, 49, 343, 9, 81, 729]

It should be fine regarding compatibility as that syntax is
currently just an error.
I guess it still needs some more examples for testing though.

ciao,
  Torsten.

You also need to set the convexity, try convexity = 5.

Actually, if you draw just one side you will see your bug. The holes are
drilled in the opposite side of the V, so have no effect.

Thank you, that was the issue.  I was drawing the holes on the wrong side, I
thought I had checked that but I guess not.  I can't believe it was
something so silly.  I will have to keep that in mind for other shapes.

nophead, this is beautiful - thanks! 

The comments are particularly helpful to me as I design more complex shapes
that can't be composed from cylinder(), cube(), sphere(), etc.

I just found  this <http://www.vagrearg.org>  (I know I'm a bit slow) but it
seems pretty nice CAM solution. Jump onto this page to save some time and
see how the move command etc shares a certain similarity with openSCAD's
translate etc...
http://www.vagrearg.org/content/gcmc-intro

IF there was a way to iterate through the projection() and get the result as
a 2D shape
THEN it looks quite promising.
I know we can export as svg and do this as an external set of command line
commands. Maybe for now that's the best way
but integration from within OpenSCAD woudl be cool.

You know you're getting old, but you also know there's a hope for the future,
when a ten year old looks at your OpenSCAD source code and says....

That looks like Java!



So here's a toast to the OpenSCAD crew.. you're building something of value
here.......

I have openscad set to automatically update (and include snapshots).
Which works just fine on osx.

Does the auto update include updates to the MCAD library as well? Or do I
need to get them from somewhere else? And if so, where would the official
MCAD library be?

This isn't an official statement, but

https://github.com/openscad/MCAD

looks like the official version. You'll notice it was last updated 11
months ago.

i kinda figured that.
I did a grep on child(), and assign(), and found a number of occurances.

would it help, if I listed the files that had either of those?

Finding the files is a one-line. Changing it, testing it and filing a pull request is what would take time.
It might help talking to hyperair (https://github.com/hyperair) as he the closest we?ve got to a maintainer for MCAD. See e.g. the dev branch: https://github.com/openscad/MCAD/tree/dev

There are already 21 pending pull requests on the master branch, mostly
from 2014. Looks like the child()/assign() problems are fixed in some of
those pull requests.

Okay, now I'm looking at the dev branch. It was last updated 2 months ago.
I see that child()->children() and assign() fixes have already been made
there.

so, then it will be merged into master soon?
if so, I can just get the zip file, and replace it?

Or you could just get a ZIP of the dev branch. It's just a matter of
selecting the correct branch in the drop down list.

OpenSCAD is very nice indeed. However, I don't think it looks anything 
like Java :-)

But the topic of the modeling language itself is an interesting one. 
About 6 months ago I mentioned on this list "... I think it would have 
been easier and better if an existing language had been adapted 
(AngelScript is another example) instead of developing a new one."

It has taken me a while to find time to prototype this idea, but at 
least I have now done something. If anyone is interested, you can read 
about it here http://arnholm.org/angelscript-csg/

As mentioned it is a prototype, meaning the main purpose is to explore 
the idea of using an existing object oriented language to express CSG 
modelling.

There are a number of OpenSCAD-like projects that use an existing general
purpose procedural language to do CSG modelling. For example, OpenJSCAD
(javascript), IceSL (Lua), Antimony (Python), ShapeJS (javascript).

The benefit is that you get a more powerful language than what OpenSCAD
currently provides.

The main drawback is that the programming model is more complicated, and
you usually have to write more code to get the same effects. For example,
the AngelScript CSG examples are full of type declarations, and other
syntax that is more awkward than in OpenSCAD.

So, it's a tradeoff. Personally, I think that a well designed and easy to
use domain-specific language is the right choice for CSG modelling if your
main focus is designing models, while an embedding of CSG modelling in
general purpose language X is better if you are an experienced X
programmer, or if you are doing CSG in conjunction with something else that
is well supported by X.

Thank you for the references to those projects, they are quite 
interesting and advanced. To me it looks like they aim for more than I 
had in mind for the AngelScript CSG prototype. For example, IceSL and 
Antimony look more like inteactive tools.

To edit the scipt directly is more what I had in mind, that is the best 
aspect of OpenSCAD also, IMHO.

> The benefit is that you get a more powerful language than what OpenSCAD

Indeed. In a language like AngelScript you can either just use what is 
there, just like in OpenSCAD, but you can also do more when you need to, 
including designing your own script classes for example.

It does not have to be more complicated, and what is complicated can be 
very subjective. The tiny example obviously benefits OpenSCAD because it 
is so simple. However I think it starts to pay off once things get bigger.

I am going to try and use AngelScript namespaces and then remove the 
"csg_" prefixes in the initial prototype. It will make it look much 
cleaner. I agree simplicty is important ("As simple as possible, but no 
simpler").

That is a fair personal assessment. I do think, however, that a language 
like AngelScript is manageable by about the same people able to handle 
the OpenSCAD language. Keep in mind that there are also features in 
OpenSCAD that are not easy to grasp even for seasoned programmers ("list 
comprehensions").

I am currently evaluating what i have learned so far and will write 
about it on my blog when I have made a revised update.

Thanks for your feedback.

got the zip file.

In your opinion, would it be better to REPLACE what is in MCAD directory
(library), or make a new directory like MCADdev?

See  Libraries <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Libraries> 
, you could put it in the user-defined library path. Any use <MCAD/...> will
load from there first.

Otherwise, just rename MCAD directory to MCAD.old...just in case you need to
compare them.

Hello Parkinbod,

very interesting. I spend some time on finding how interpolation works and
begin to understand what you are doing. However there is a small bug in your
horn file causing an unfinished circle:

/function circle_(r, N) = 
    [   // input:   radius r and the number of vectors
        // output:  N vectors on edge of circle with radius r
        for(i=[0:N-1]) 
            // internal help variabel w = angle
            let(w = i*360/N) 
            // produce x and y
            [r*sin(w), r*cos(w)]
    ];/

this should be:
*function circle_(r, N) = 
    [   // input:   radius r and the number of vectors
        // output:  N vectors on edge of circle with radius r
        for(i=[0:N-1]) 
            // internal help variabel w = angle
            let(w = i*360/(N-1)) 
            // produce x and y
            [r*sin(w), r*cos(w)]
    ];*

Thanks for looking at the code. I don't see a bug, as polygon() closes a
figure itself. Both versions seem to work, but yours produces the initial
point twice - don't know whether polygon treats this case internally. But
let's see what happens:

Just FYI, I got OpenSCAD to work again.  Here is what I did.

1) Uninstalled OpenSCAD
2) Remove EVERY reference to OpenSCAD in the Windows Registry
3) Installed latest version OpenSCAD

It now seems to be working fine.

Is there a way to script exporting of models to STL files?  I have created
some modules where I can pass parameters to the modules to create a bunch of
different shapes of various sizes and between the number of modules and the
parameters that can be passed to the modules there are over 200 different
STL files to be generated.  I would REALLY rather not do this manually if at
all possible.

Ah, good point! 
Thanks for putting me on the right track! It is not the circle, but some
strange habit of my sweep() function, which doesn't close polygons itself. I
should give it a review some day to also work with standard semantics.

As expected the equivalent function  skin()
<https://github.com/openscad/list-comprehension-demos/blob/master/skin.scad>  
works correctly with both versions: 


> use 
> <splines.scad>

Your version seems to work with both, but does a N-1-polygon only. To please
sweep(), skin() and the N-semantics: 

function circle_(r, N) = [
  for(i=[0:N]) let(w = i*360/N)
    [r*sin(w), r*cos(w)]];

Message-ID: <1451480097138-15363.post@n5.nabble.com>

I have an Openscad file for a saxophone key with a lot of parameters, that
can change depending on the brand of the saxophone and the type of key that
I want to add in the future.

To keep the code readable I made a separate scad file with parameters that
is imported in the head of the scad. I wonder if there is an easy way to
maintain the whole serie of parameters in an excel file and import a
selected file to Openscad.
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n15363/parameters.jpg> 
So I made an excel file where the set of parameters is selectable and in one
column the code appears that I can copy and paste to openscad.

Is there a better way to link Excel to Openscad?

I am sure there are people that have more knowledge about this than me,
but Excel can export to txt file, and OpenSCAD can be set to 
surveillance changes in a scad file.

Eventually, if you could get Excel (Via macro automation or VBA, or 
manually if all fails) to calculate and export to file what you want, 
OpenSCAD would then notice the change in that file and recompile?

You can do it all in the OpenScad file by putting the parameters in names
lists, one for each model of saxaphone and simply passing that named list
to a module to draw it or assigning it to a global variable.

I've just been doing something similar --- I have an Excel spreadsheet
which has several worksheets w/ the client data in it, and a
``customization'' worksheet which imports all the settings specified by the
customer, in the proper order and wrapped up w/ conditional cells which
only populate w/ TeX commands if the matching cell has content:

=IF(B13="","",1) --- repeated all the way down in a column

=IF(SUM(F13:F16)=4,"\fouruppage{",IF(SUM(F13:F16)=3,"\fouruppageThree{",IF(SUM(F13:F16)=2,"\fouruppageTwo{",IF(SUM(F13:F16)=1,"\fouruppageOne{",IF(SUM(F13:F16)=0,"")))))

&c.

(It was a lot easier than reading the customer files into lualatex and
redefining the macros there)

I made a macro in the excel file that reacts on just a button click and
exports the table to an scad file.
So it is just two clicks to modify: One in the excel and then F5 to refresh
Openscad.

This is the macro listing:
Sub Macro1()
Dim myFile As String, rng As Range, cellValue As Variant, i As Integer, j As
Integer

nophead?s suggestion sounds decent to me.
I?d be interested in what your ideal solution would look like.

As a teaser: We?ve been discussing introducing dictionary-style objects as a core datatype in OpenSCAD. This would allow us to import e.g. JSON documents and store the resulting object as an OpenSCAD value.
This is just one idea. If you have others, please share!

Marius may be referring to my OpenSCAD2 proposal, in which "dictionary
objects" are just called "objects".
The OpenSCAD2 docs are in github: https://github.com/doug-moen/openscad2/

The object proposal is here:
   https://github.com/doug-moen/openscad2/blob/master/rfc/Objects.md

https://github.com/doug-moen/openscad2/blob/master/rfc/Programming_With_Objects.md

There are lots of use cases given: you might as well click through and read
about them in the linked documents.

Thanks for sharing your code. This is a cool example of curved surfaces and
splines in a real engineering type of model.

Yes, I was referring to the OpenSCAD2 proposal. Thanks for the actual links!
In that document, perhaps we should add some more concrete use-cases the kind of dictionary usage discussed here, or even hint at things like JSON import?

Really nice work. That's probably the most you can get outta
excel-controlled openscad. (I was trying to see if openscad has any dll that
I can insert into Excel as Add-in. Guess not). 

You can also turn on the "Automatically Reload and Preview" in OpenSCAD.
Then, have excel and openscad opened side by side, you can enjoy one click
on the [Export to SCAD file] button and see it changed automatically.
Comparing to other approach, which focus only on data, this excel-approach
has the advantage of using Excel as both a data holder and a GUI like the
button you put on there.

Besides what are proposed for the OpenSCAD2, you can also refer to the
*hash* approach that I've been using:  here
<http://forum.openscad.org/parameterized-models-td8303.html#a8306>   and 
here

Just FYI, I was able to replicate this problem and fortunately my solution
worked again.  This time I was doing a batch conversion from a directory of
a bunch scad files and exporting them to stl files.  Half way through I
realized there was an issue with my scad files and I aborted the command
line batch script.  Doing this made it so that OpenSCAD would start but not
actually open any files, it would just get the intro window of recent files
and when I would selected any option it would go away and OpenSCAD would
never actually start.  

So this earlier solution I posted worked again fortunately.

1) Uninstalled OpenSCAD
2) Remove EVERY reference to OpenSCAD in the Windows Registry
3) Installed latest version OpenSCAD

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Generate OpenSCAD models from AngelScript
Message-ID: <568445B4.8050506@arnholm.org>

Hi,

I hope I am not breaking any rules by posting this, if you believe I am 
just say so and I will go away :-)

In another thread I recently mentioned that I am experimenting with 
AngelScript for creating CSG models, using OpenSCAD as the "back end" 
via its .csg file format.

(I said I would write about it on my blog when there was anything new, 
but due to technical problems I cannot access it at the moment, so 
instead this message)

I have done quite a bit the last couple of days and I believe have some 
decent results. As an example, this rotate sweep was done without the 
upcoming rotate_extrude in OpenSCAD:

http://arnholm.org/software/as_csg/test_sweep_rotate.png

This is the AngelScript CSG code to produce the above:

#include "lib_sweep.as"    // provides general sweep features
#include "lib_degrees.as"  // provides deg/rad conversions

shape@ main_shape()
{
    // specify a rotation sweep of a circle profile
    double s_rad  = 100;           // sweep radius
    double s_ang  = to_rad(120);   // sweep angle=120deg
    uint   s_nseg = 60;            // sweep #segments
    double c_rad  = 30;            // circle radius
    shape2d@ xsec = circle(c_rad); // sweep profile

    // use path_rotate for the sweep
    return sweep(path_rotate(xsec,s_rad,s_ang,s_nseg));
}

void main()
{
    shape@ obj = main_shape();
    obj.write_csg(GetOutputFullPath('.csg'));
}


The sweep function is implemented in AngelScript, and it is general 
enough to allow different kind of sweeping, for example a completely 
custom one:

http://arnholm.org/software/as_csg/test_sweep_custom.png

shape@ main_shape()
{
    // specify a custom sweep of a circle profile
    uint   s_nseg = 60;            // sweep #segments
    double s_h    = 100.0;         // sweep height
    double c_rad  = 30;            // circle radius
    shape2d@ xsec = circle(c_rad); // sweep profile

    path_custom path(circle(c_rad),s_h,s_nseg);
    return sweep(path);
}

void main()
{
    shape@ obj = main_shape();
    obj.write_csg(GetOutputFullPath('.csg'));
}


Notice "path_custom" instead of "path_rotate" as in the first example. 
The sweep function itself is exactly the same in the 2 cases:

solid@ sweep(path_sweep@ path)
{
     uint nseg = path.nseg(); // # of segments
     double dp = 1.0/nseg;    // delta parameter
     double  p = 0.0;         // start parameter
     solid@ end1 = path.slice(p);
     solid@[] segments;
     for(uint iseg=0; iseg<nseg; iseg++) {
        solid@ end2 = path.slice(p+=dp);
        segments.push_back(hull3d(end1,end2));
        @end1 = @end2;
     }
     return union3d(segments);
}

The point is that the sweep function uses an interface to a path which 
can be implemented for various scenarios, of which rotate is only one.

interface path_sweep
{
    uint   nseg();          // number of segments in path
    solid@ slice(double p); // thin slice at parameter p [0,1]
}

In any case, I have put together a Windows installation for anyone who 
wants to give it a try. Just download and install. There is no GUI other 
than OpenSCAD, "as_csg" is a console program that converts .as files 
into OpenSCAD .csg files. A "samples" folder is included, plus a 
compiled HTML help file. The samples contain everything to reproduce the 
images linked to above.

Here is the download
http://arnholm.org/software/as_csg/AngelScript_CSG_setup_D1.0-00.exe

I guess if you need support, we should not spam this list. Instead you 
can send question to me at arnholm at arnholm.org

Kind regards
Carsten Arnholm

Hi, check/replace your antivirus. It is a false alarm.

Although that's quite likely, you /are/ distributing a closed source 
Windows executable that triggers a Virustotal hit for 
HEUR/QVM06.1.Malware.Gen:

https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/1ec1b0f19e7789075651d78778dd78b7fdd74bb314afe4e56add98f17bd194f6/analysis/1451519369/

If I were running Windows, I'd treat that file with the same casual 
nonchalance as I would any other lump of glowing-hot radioactive metal.

It might be a false alarm or you might be at the leading edge of Yet 
Another Windows botnet; there's no way to tell from outside.

Do as you please. The file is clean.

Now I suggest these reports are sent straight to me with some more 
actual facts rather than simple accusations. I have checked and there is 
nothing.

I can explain why it was a false alarm, I let the setup program 
(optionally) update the user PATH so it would be easier to run. I have 
removed that feature, so people will have to do it manually. There 
really isn't anything nefarious, and there never was.

That's all.

Hi,
I didn't accused you of anything, I simply reported a fact.
After that I navigate your blog just to try to download the file however but
I couldn't find it.

No problem, see the other comments.

As reported, I cannot access my blog right now, that is why the link 
isn't there. The blog will be updated when the access issue is solved. 
See the first message for link to Windows executable.

Here is a Linux binary with the exact same features (yes, virus scan ok)
http://arnholm.org/software/as_csg/angelscript_csg_d1.0-11_kubuntu_1510.tar.gz

Built on Linux Kubuntu 15.10 64bit

It loads a shared object so to run you may have to say
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.


Kind regards

How would removing a zero-area triangle leave a non-zero-area hole?

You most likely end up with a vertex meeting an edge whereas vertices
should always meet other vertices. The zero area triangle can have non zero
length.

You do end up with a zero area hole, but it is still topologically a hole.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Happy NEW YEAR!
Message-ID: <1451565515392-15391.post@n5.nabble.com>

Last year I did  Xmas <http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:608303>  

Unfortunately I have not been proactive enough this year, for Xmas, or New
Year...

So waiting for the fireworks here (at Oz), (I was watching the movie /Good
Kill/ - best I've seen this year - had its own fireworks...), I have less
than 30 minutes before 2400hrs, which for my sobriety levels is not likely
to be productive for a celabratory design; so a challenge - for those who
have more lead time, an OpenSCAD animation reflective of a Happy New Year???

(2100hrs Kiddies Fireworks at Sydney, [looks Photoshopped], apparently 24MB
- million bucks worth)

I tried the sweep again with circles giving another small problem.

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n15392/bugsweep.jpg> 

This is the file I use:

curved_barrel_bes_clarinet_v4.scad
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n15392/curved_barrel_bes_clarinet_v4.scad>  

I also tried this with skin.
Resulting in this messags:

Thanks again for producing test cases. I haven't had time to revise the code. 

But skin() works with me. It includes some more libs, which should be in the
path ... This will solve your problem

Hi Rudolf, no problem.
But I think I miss some essential libs for skin to work.

Message-ID: <1451583057530-15399.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hello everyone,

I have just uploaded my OpenScad library for string and vector operations!!

I am waiting for comments, bug reports, aditional features, any feedbacks.
:-)

Enjoy!!

And I have also a question, where to put this in the OpenScad repo ?
This library contains generic functions which could be usefull for a next
OpenScad version.

Thank you!

Nathana?l

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Happy New Year + OpenSCAD syntax lexer for SynWrite
Message-ID: <1451621185549-15402.post@n5.nabble.com>

Happy New Year to all dear fellow OpenSCADists! To enjoy our journey of
OpenSCAD in the new 2016 to come, allow me to present a present: an OpenSCAD
syntax lexer for the editor  SynWrite <http://www.uvviewsoft.com/synwrite/> 
.

It's a lexer intended to deal with large and/or complicated scad files.
Users will be able to divide large code into sections, in-function sections
and in-module sections, all are blocks that can be folded and easily
navigated through the syntax tree panel. 

The lexer already being incorporated into the SynWrite library, so you can
get right to it once the SynWrite is installed. Couple of screenshots :

*1. The synwrite_syntax_demo.scad domonstrating all the features of the
lexer:*

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n15402/2015-12-31_Screenshot_demo_file.png> 

*2. foldable in-function sections*

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n15402/2015-12-31_screenshot_in-func_sect.png> 

*3. Foldable in-module sections*

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n15402/2015-12-31_screenshot_in-mod_sect.png> 

*4. William Adam's math lib as viewed with this lexer*

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n15402/2015-12-31_18_58_15-Screenshot_WilliamAdams_Math_lib.png> 


To load it to your SynWrite, just go to [Options]/ [Add-ons Manager] /
[Install]

To use it, select it in the status bar on the bottom of editor.

The demonstrating file, synwrite_syntax_demo.scad, can be downloaded from
the thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1237864
<http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1237864>  .Enjoy !
