Subject: [OpenSCAD] Assign statement seems neccessary
Message-ID: <1435735484999-12966.post@n5.nabble.com>

I was constructing this object in OpenSCAD
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:476845/#files
I downloaded the code and got the deprecation msg so I tried to remove the
assign statements.

Unfortunately the end results does not match. It appears the Assign allows a
sweep to occur and simple variable assignment creates discrete objects.
Please compare these two images.
Is there a way to get the same result without using the Assign statement ?
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n12966/OpenSCAD-bridging_spiral-Assign-statement.png> 
Original code with Assign statement
Test-bridging_spiral-orig.scad
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n12966/Test-bridging_spiral-orig.scad>  
My attempt to remove it
Test-bridging_spiral-noassign.scad
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n12966/Test-bridging_spiral-noassign.scad>  

Debug variable info is echo'd - and appears identical.

Working pretty well but its adhoc nature is starting to defeat you.
There are many alg for creating these and you have chosen one where the
triangles grow from the center out. You have oversized the geo so there is
overlap for your physical model.
- Note that the oversized factor in sier never works unless you make only a
single triangle.
Actually it looks like it was from thingiverse...

Another approach would be to use a non recursive routine. This will be
easier to control the oversize for overlaps.
Another approach would be to have the first triangle become the largest
encompassing triangle then every level beings to subtract the geo from the
prior models. OpenSCAD is good at this.

Check out some online algorithms for creation. Your initial foray was
finding a python program. These can be easy to read and a good source of
info. There are many pages on Sierpinski algorithms online.

Remember the volume of a triangle and volume of a sphere are calculated
differently and this factor difference is what you need to get the right
size for spheres.
Try starting with a more normalised pyramid. The math might be easier.

If you simply replace the assigns with assignment statements it works fine
but you also made other changes and broke it by adding a semicolon after
the hull on line 85.

Note there was no need to change the variable names.

You also broke the hull on line 66 but that makes little visual difference.
It just fill in some small gaps at the end of the spokes.

Michael:

This approach is working very well for me.  After pulling the sin/cos 
function out of your code, I now have a flexible way to create a variety 
of horn geometries.  Nice!

After I press F5, the Console says that it has completed the computation 
in under a second, but it takes about 5 seconds for the rendering to 
take place.  This is mildly annoying, but what is really annoying is 
that for the next minute or so, the cursor alters between normal and 
hourglass every 5 or 10 seconds.  It is as if it thinks I asked for an 
adjustment in the rendered view, but I have not.  Given how long the 
rendering takes, this is very time consuming.

I wonder if there is some bug that is not visible with a "normal" 
instantaneous render, but is appearing now that the render takes so long.

Imagine that I try to reorient the rendered image by dragging.  I 
imagine that a series of renders are thus requested.  It would be nice 
if that queue were managed better for the case where the render is 
taking more than 0.1 seconds.  I think that all but the first and last 
render request should be discarded.

For long F6 runs, I usually minimize OpenSCAD and check on it 
periodically.  If OpenSCAD were to pop up a "Completed!" message box, 
either when minimized or when the calculations too more than (say) 5 
seconds, I could then see it in the task bar and act on that information 
immediately.

I got cute, and had the horns go up and then down.  This is the result.  
Any hints about how to orient the cylinders so that they are normal to 
the path?

Thanks nophead. Looks like I'm the knobhead.
Those pesky semicolons...
The names were changed to hepl me to undestand what the code was doing (of
course).

Cheers...

Yeh, I had noted that too, very annoying. I suspect the refresh is under Qt
control.
You need to keep you mouse cursor out of the display window.
That is the display driver latency when a high poly count AFAIK.

No sorry, I would have to redo my high school maths, that makes my brain
hurt...

With my program the shapes are always placed normal to the path.
Just give me the math you used for the path.

These games lie.
They just draw the hairs so that they are partly within and partly outside
the scull.
Openscad actually calculates the intersection of a hair and the scull to
make a real 3d model.
And that is a slow process as it calculates the intersection points with a
very high precision.

Peter:

As much as I appreciate your approach, it turned out that I needed the 
approach that subtracted an InnerHorn from the InnerHorn, in order to 
clean up some other geometry (punching a hole through the base/stand).  
I suppose I can try to meld your normals and Michael's cylinders...

Peter:

Apologies.  I read your code more thoroughly, and it does do the 
difference() that I require.  And it has the shapes consistently normal. 
So, best of both worlds.

I believe that OpenSCAD F6 is at least a thousand times slower than it
should be (this is model dependent). And this is fixable.

Here are some tasks for the "speed up F6" project.


   1. Get rid of implicit unions wherever feasible, and especially at the
   top level. This means that the final result of F6 may be a model with
   overlapping top level polyhedra. This will provide a massive speedup for
   models that work by overlapping a large number of top level objects,
   especially spheres. The commands for exporting to a file (STL, etc) will
   now need an option for whether you want to perform a top level union. This
   will slow down STL export if the option is selected, but many slicers don't
   require this.
   2. Replace CGAL with a fast floating point CSG engine.
      1. Refactor OpenSCAD so that it is easy to plug in an alternate
      engine.
   3. F6 should use multiple cores. I haven't looked at all of the
   candidate replacement CSG engines, but I suspect that this is something
   that needs to be handled in our rendering code, not in the engine per se
   (except that the engine needs to be thread safe). Rendering all of the
   children in a group should become a parallel operation that can be
   distributed across multiple cores.
   4. F6 should use the GPU. I haven't investigated this at all.


Of these, #1 get rid of implicit union is the low hanging fruit.

Did I miss anything?

Doug Moen.

GNU Handbrake (AKA GHB), a video format conversion program uses a system
tray progress doodad for this purpose and I find it both unobtrusive and
useful. Perhaps the inspiration could be borrowed.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] request-for-comments: object properties and/or alignment?
Message-ID: <20150702180351.GA18479@localhost>

Hi,

is there a standard way to automatically or semi-automatically center
and/or align objects?

The center-parameter of e.g. cube() can only center it in all axes or
none, but I would like to be able to selectively center it and to
align it to the positive or negative side of an axis. I know I can
do this by adding translate(), but I don't like that I have to manually
enter the size of the object into the translate-parameters.

So, I have two ideas:

1. Adding a parameter to all my modules, e.g.:

   module mytest(..., align=[1,1,1]) {
	...
   }

   "align" has three elements, one for each axis. Each element can have
   three values: 0 = center on this axis, 1 = object is on positive side
   of the axis, -1 = object is on the negative side of the axis.

   Have you already done something like this? Is there a standard-name
   for the parameter I named "align"? Or is there abetter/easier way?


2. Using/adding object-properties (or local-scoped contants):
   (similar to the ideas of https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/301)

   If I could access some object-properies (either set manually or
   determined automatically like on the linked post), I could write
   generic alignment-functions/modules.

   Example:

   module mytest() {
	SIZE_X = 10;	// manually given, since it could be hard to
	SIZE_Y = 20;	// determine automatically on more complex
	SIZE_Z = 30;	// objects
	CENTER = [5,10,15];
	color("red")	// could automatically define "COLOR"
	    cube([10, 20, 30]);
   }
   module center(object, center=[false, false, false]) {
	translate([center[0] ? -children().CENTER[0] : 0,
		   center[1] ? -children().CENTER[1] : 0,
		   center[2] ? -children().CENTER[2] : 0])
	children();
   }
   module align(object, align=[0, 0, 0]) {
	translate([align[0] ? -children().CENTER[0]+children().SIZE_X : 0,
		   align[1] ? -children().CENTER[1]+children().SIZE_Y : 0,
		   align[2] ? -children().CENTER[2]+children().SIZE_Z : 0])
	children();
   }

   The code doesn't work, but the idea should be clear.

   I think this approach would be quite powerful, make it possible to
   automatically align or stack things, mix the colors of objects on
   union()) and may things I currently don't think of. But it would
   probably be quite complex, too.

   What do you think?


best regards
Roland

Solving this problem is one of my goals for the OpenSCAD2 project that I'm
working on. The code you've written for idea #2 is pretty close to valid
OpenSCAD2 code. In other words, the language does support object
properties, using pretty much the syntax you describe.

Unfortunately, this is all just in the design phase right now. There's no
working code that I can share. But I agree with your proposal.

Yeah, IceSL is very interesting from the technical perspective but...

- IceSL is: Free for non-commercial use
- IceSL is: Currently only distributed for Windows
- IceSL is: Only distributed as binary

bringing the total of my personal interest for the project as such
to about zero.

The idea itself is cool but I still would not see it as the only
or ultimate solution. I guess there's still a good number of use
cases where generating an actual model file is useful.

Also writing a slicer that can handle general models is a huge task
with both slic3r and cura-engine doing some impressive work.
While I see some possible benefits of having a combined modeller and
slicer, in reality (mainly with limited development resources) it's
probably still better to have the higher flexibility due to multiple
projects that can be combined using STL/AMF/... files as interface.
Just looking at how people prefer one slicer over the other shows
we are far away from the one single solution that fits everybody and
every model.

I have been keeping my cursor out of the display window, but even so, 
the thing redraws perhaps 5 times before anything useful appears.  So I 
sit there for 2-3 minutes waiting for the display to appear.  If I click 
on the icon to display the full object, that takes another 2-3 minutes 
of repeated displays.

Something is really wrong.  I mean, other than the fact that my 
particular model has a lot of triangles.

Why do you want so many triangles, anyway?
What is the resolution you need in the end?


?
I dont have your code, but it looks to me, that you just union a lot of
cylinders together. That always be slow.
If you would use a chain hull algorithm, you can use much less cylinders
and still get a smooth surface.
You just cant brute force everything in OpenScad.
You also may have a lock at the sweep algorithm, that is super fast for
these things.

Share your code and we can give you some pointers.

Thanks for posting about IceSL. There are some interesting ideas in here
that I'd ideally like to see also in OpenSCAD.

quote: "Our software lets triangle meshes and analytical primitives be
combined through CSG operations."

This is something I've always wanted. I read "analytical primitives" as
including mathematically correct spheres, cylinders and cones that are not
faceted approximations. I've wanted this since the first time I saw a
sphere in OpenSCAD.

ImplicitCAD is an OpenSCAD clone with analytical primitives. The project
ran into trouble with generating STL files, since they couldn't find an
efficient algorithm for converting the analytic implicit function represent
to meshes. However, you can quite easily slice this representation.

A slicer is a big complex program: generating the slices is only a small
part of the job. There is also generating the skin vs generating the
interior fill pattern, generating support structure, wipe towers,
generating the tool path, with all the hardware dependencies that that
implies.

Much easier and more practical than building an entire slicer is to output
a voxel file instead of a mesh file. If open source slicers supported the
SVX file format, then it would be feasible to build an analytic version of
OpenSCAD that bypasses STL mesh generation and slices directly to SVX.

quote: "This process allows for other interesting features, such as slice
shaders: Small programs that can select the material being used in every
point of space."

There was a project at MIT exploring this same idea. But instead of
building a CSG language into a slicer, they defined the standard interface
between the CSG language processor and the GCODE generator (printer driver)
to be a voxel stream, so you don't have to generate the entire voxel file
before you can start printing the first layer. This architecture supports a
modular toolchain, which is what we want: the IceSL all-in-one architecture
is not a good one for us. And they demonstrated some really cool effects by
controlling the material at every point in space.
http://spec2fab.mit.edu/Spec2Fab.pdf

The Spec2Fab people released some GPL'ed code in 2013, but not everything
you'd need to reproduce their work. Then they went silent while they tried
to figure out how to commercialize the work and get rich.

Anyway, I would like the open source 3D printing community to support voxel
representations as inputs to slicers, one way or another. I figure the SVX
file format is probably the best way forward, since it exists, it is
simple, it's an open standard, and there's already a good reason to use it:
Shapeways supports it, and some models that Shapeways can print are too
complex and fine grained to be represented as meshes, you have to use
voxels.

Once voxels are accepted as input to 3D printers, then we can introduce
analytic primitives, with which you can do really cool things.

quote: "The time between modelling and printing is greatly reduced,
allowing users to perform small adjustments while quickly previewing the
result object and G-code ."

So this is a benefit that you get from the IceSL all-in-one architecture,
or the MIT modular voxel stream architecture, that you don't get from SVX
files.

quote: "CSG operations between triangle meshes are notoriously difficult to
achieve. This is essentially due to numerical issues in the intersection of
geometric primitives. OpenSCAD relies on the CGAL library 4 ? an excellent
choice since it provides robust numerical computations for geometry
processing. However, the price to pay is a long processing time. Giving
away numerical robustness is however not an option: The slicing process
cannot recover from holes or cracks in the geometry."

I really hope this isn't true. I think it is really important to the
OpenSCAD project to get that 1000x speedup of F6 that we all want, by
switching to a floating point geometry engine. Yes, the algorithms need to
be more complicated to achieve numerical stability, but someone has already
done the work, we just need to find the best open source engine to replace
CGAL.

quote: "Comparatively CSG operations are much simpler to perform in a ray-
tracing context [GAC+89]: The CSG operations can be performed along the
ray, after computing the ray?primitive intersections independently. This
has been used to perform CSG on polygonal models, converting back and forth
between a ray?based representation of the geometry and a polygonal model
[WLC10]."

This is interesting. I think it implies that our preview can be made more
accurate than it currently is, that render() shouldn't be necessary to make
the preview look correct. It sounds like a lot of work to implement, but
with excellent results. With this design, the preview is perfectly
accurate, there's no difference between F5 and F6 in the view pane. The GPU
is leveraged to make the preview fast. And the same code can also generate
voxels for output, without going through the expensive F6 rendering process
(CSG on meshes).

Reading this stuff just makes me think that STL and AMF need to die, and
the community needs to move forward to a voxel based future.

But you can't generate first-layer voxels until you determine whether 
upper-layer features will require support structures. The slicer (which 
knows the printer's geometry requirements) must analyze the *entire* 
object to add those additional, non-model voxels, before hot goo hits 
the platform.

AFAICT, every single slicer project has started with the fundamental 
premise that all preceding slicers are *way* too complex, so there's 
good reason to keep geometric modeling and tool path generation entirely 
separate.

The software I'm referring to is called "openfab". I don't know in detail
how it works. It's a network protocol whereby a modelling program (like
OpenSCAD) communicates with a slicer, as an alternative to generating an
STL or SVX file, then loading it into the slicer. The authors claim that
the 3D printer can start working more quickly if the modeller and the
slicer are communicating via openfab, than if they are communicating via a
file. And I believe they described the communication as a pipeline. "We
describe a streaming architecture for OpenFab; only a small fraction of the
final volume is stored in memory and output is fed to the printer with
little startup delay." Anyway, it seems plausible that something like
OpenFab could work as described. I assume the protocol allows two way
communication.

Your point about support material is a good one; I don't know for sure if
or how they implement that. The goals of OpenFab are to enable a modular
toolchain, enable the creation of "metamaterials" by interleaving different
materials at the micrometer level, and have high performance. By reading
between the lines, I think that support material generation can be
implemented in their system as a "fablet", which means it's an independent
module, and doesn't have to be hard coded into the slicer. So support might
be in a different stage of the pipeline than you expect, while preserving a
modular system.

They originally proposed to turn this into an open standard. I haven't seen
any movement since 2013, and I can't access the original paper right now,
as OpenFab.mit.edu is down.

You don't want floats. They have all the wrong properties. You want fixed
point integer. Floats mean the accuracy of your object varies with
distance, it means that merely translating a valid object in space can
create an invalid object or lose detail.

Even if you use floats you can't use them *as* floats instead you must
use them with a dictionary so they are not really "float" but dictionary
entries, each of which represents a point in space, and processed to
avoid ambiguities. Fixed point is actually faster, even without using
vectorising instructions.

(The dictionary handling is something many STL conversion and
scaling/modification tools ignore entirely and one reason STL tools are
generally completely crap)

Hi, Alan.
I've thought about your argument for fixed point, but I'm not convinced.

I can come up with my own argument for why floats are generally better
than fixed point. However, I wouldn't trust my argument either.

What would be convincing is empirical evidence: someone has built
a fixed point CSG engine and shown that it works better than a floating
point
CSG engine. Marius and others have talked about replacing CGAL with a
faster engine, which we preferably don't build from scratch, but just borrow
from another open source project. Do we know of any existing fixed point
CSG engines?

I agree that fixed point has an advantage for translations. You can
translate
a fixed point object along a fixed point vector exactly, with no loss of
information.
However, floating point works better for the other affine transformations.
Fixed point loses precision if you scale down, whereas floating point can
scale
with negligible loss of precision. Rotation requires sine and cosine.
If you compare 64 bit floats with 64 bit fixed point (32 bits before and
after
the binary point), then sine has 32 bits of precision with fixed point, but
it has 53 bits of precision with floating point. So rotations are much more
accurate with floating point.

Since fixed point is generally worse than floating point for affine
transformations
(except for translate), I figure that you'd need dictionary handling just
as much
in a fixed point CSG engine.

I don't really know how valid my argument is, since I've never built
a CSG engine.

Alan:

You say:

"Floats mean the accuracy of your object varies with distance, it means 
that merely translating a valid object in space can create an invalid 
object or lose detail. "

I understand why what you say is true in THEORY.  With 15 digits of 
precision, one would have to move a 1 mm cube to the moon to encounter 
this problem.  Have you really encountered this problem in real life in 
a realistic model (with feature details of 0.1 mm and maximum model size 
of 200 mm)?

Here is a conference paper from 1998 that describes
how fixed point works better than floating point for certain kinds of
CSG computations.
http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jarek/papers/ExactCSG.pdf

I don't understand the paper well enough yet to see what the implications of
this might be for OpenSCAD.

hi everybody,

try this code:

difference () {
    cube([3,60,60]);

    translate([0,30,30])
        rotate([0,90,0])
            cylinder(r=15,h=3);
}

You will see that the rotated cylinder is "strange"...

is there a bug in OpenSCAD ?

thanx and congrat for OpenScad, it's a wonderful software !!!

Hi Jon. After skimming the article whose link I just posted,
I gather that the problem is not with the absolute amount of precision
in a floating point number, but with the numerical behaviour of floats
during CSG operations.

With a naive implementation of CSG operations, numbers that should be
equal aren't, due to floating point approximation and loss of precision.
So gaps open up in a polyhedron, making it non-manifold and not
3D-printable.
You fix that, and other things go wrong.
Models acquire additional facets that shouldn't be there.
Maybe you fix that as well using "dictionaries" or some other technique.
But now "A union B" produces a different result than "B union A",
and that might mess up some other algorithm that depends on union.

Try

difference () {
   cube([3,60,60]);

   translate([-0.005,30,30])
       rotate([0,90,0])
           cylinder(r=15,h=3.01);
}

You need to think about boundaries.

thanx for your answer, and I don't want to bother you but, what do you mean
about boundaries ? (sorry i'm a noob)

and the problem doesn't occur whitout the rotate function:

difference () {
    cube([60,60,3]);

    translate([30,30,00])
            cylinder(r=15,h=3);
}

This is a well known problem, which I think is caused by OpenSCAD using
floating point transformation matrices.

Try this as a workaround:

epsilon = 0.01;

difference () {

  cube([3,60,60]);

  translate([-epsilon,30,30])

    rotate([0,90,0])

      cylinder(r=15,h=3+2*epsilon);

}

You expect the end faces of the rotated cylinder to exactly match up with
the faces of the cuboid, but they don't match due to floating point
roundoff in the rotate. So you include a fudge factor, "epsilon", make the
cylinder slightly taller than 3mm, and make sure the cylinder sticks out
past the cuboid faces on both sides.

OK, but then a "support fablet" must accumulate the entire model before 
it emits the first layer, which means the fancy bidirectional pipeline 
clogs with anything other than the sort of bracket-shaped lumps I design.

That fablet must also know *everything* the slicer knows, too, in order 
to generate the proper support shapes with the correct spacings. I 
suppose the fablets could all use the same configuration file, but that 
quickly degenerate into arguments about which non-relational DB will 
support concurrent updates from various fablets along the toolchain.

I'm not seeing how this is a big win for anything other than objects in 
a simplified Master's Thesis / Physics 101 3D printing universe.

However, as a rule of thumb, MIT folks know far more than I do about any 
given subject. Perhaps this is one of those "Wait... what?" moments we 
all have.  [grin]

Rotation is done internally using trigonometry. In order for the original
code to work, it would be necessary for sin(90) == 1 and cos(90) == 0. In
the version of OpenSCAD I'm using, cos(90) != 0, so your model doesn't work
as expected.

I assume that something simple like "round all computed values to 0.01 
mm" also fails.  That is, limit point locations to a 3D grid which has a 
resolution much greater than our ability to print at the moment.

I found the OpenFab paper on archive.org, since it has otherwise
disappeared from the web.

https://web.archive.org/web/20150325142628/http://openfab.mit.edu/pdf/openfab.pdf

I may have misremembered some things about the paper (it was 2013).
However, it is a very interesting paper, and is worth discussing for the
technical approach that they use to do things that can't currently be done
using OpenSCAD.

The pipeline has both a "surface" stage and a later "volumetric" stage, and
they do discuss how support is implemented.

It's just dependent on how the graphics driver does the actual
display. I'm getting this even for

difference() {
     cube(10, center = true);
     cylinder(h = 10, r = 4, center = true);
}

No transformation involved at all, just the difference painting
triangles of different color in one plane.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-fighting

ciao,

Hi Torsten. You are reporting an F5 bug, whereas I was analyzing an F6 bug.
I think they are two different issues. I can reproduce both.
I think Easycure was also using F6, since his problem goes away with no
rotation.

Right, there was never said what to look at exactly, so I stopped
at the first issue I saw.

Hmm, there's code trying to handle sin() and cos() special cases but
that's not active for rotation(). I guess it's worth a try to catch
those too.

ciao,
   Torsten.

Not open source ones. It's actually a bit more complicated than that
however. Many CSG engines can be plugged into different types. You can
run CGAL in fixed point if you write the correct glue.

So do 3D printers. You are completely correct, and for some uses I don't
doubt float is right for this property. 3D printers just happens not to
be one of them.

Although you can compute 64:64 int faster than float on many processors.

The one you hit with the current engine is the "it's valid at 0,0 but
when you lay out 60 of them for a 3D print you get a CGAL error". The
root cause is a just touching edge but your objects behave differently
due to distance.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] OpenSCAD2 design docs
Message-ID: <CAGV6i+MbAnWFNcMeZ36JPgiVXCPAY-CDLkmLzERAz715QaE_rg@mail.gmail.com>

OpenSCAD2 is a backwards compatible redesign of OpenSCAD. Some highlights:

   - everything is a first class value, including functions, modules,
   shapes, groups and scripts
   - single unified namespace, instead of 3 namespaces for variables,
   functions and modules
   - modules are unified with functions
   - the 'module composability bug' is fixed: 'intersection' now composes
   with 'for'
   - generic sequence operations and generalized list comprehensions
   - objects: external script files are referenced as object values;
   {script} is an object literal; 'object.name' looks up a named field in
   an object
   - groups are replaced by object values; the CSG tree is a tree of objects
   - the 'use' command is fixed: it can be used to reference any library


Design spec: https://github.com/doug-moen/openscad2

At this point, I'm looking for feedback and new collaborators. There may
ways to improve parts of the design to make it easier to use, or more
powerful, or less complex, or whatever. I expect that there are still bugs
in the backward compatibility provisions that may trigger design changes.

Since it's all on github, you may open issues if you like.

I don't have any working code yet. This has turned into a big project, so
that's going to take a while, and will be implemented in multiple stages. I
expect further design changes as a result of insights developed while
implementing all of this.

In looking over the README, it all pretty much makes good sense.

However, may I make a suggestion on the one part I have read so far.

In the README, the new syntax:

elongate(n)(children) = {
  for (c = children)
    scale([n, 1, 1]) c;
};

It seems it might be a little bit clearer if it were IN instead of =

elongate(n)(children) = {
  for (c *in* children)
    scale([n, 1, 1]) c;
};

Aren't those two mutually exclusive. I have used, and seen in many other
scripts, functions/modules/variables with the same name.

What do you mean by that?

I would recommend namespaces, so that names of included/used libraries
cannot clash. I don't know how functional languages usually do this,
but I like the way Python does; for OpenSCAD it could look like:

use <mylib.scad>;
use <myotherlib.scad> as a;
from <somelib.scad> use *;
from <lib4.scad> use mod1, mod2;

mylib.myobject1();
a.myotherobject2();
mod1();

The OpenSCAD-language *is* a (functional) programming language.

And I'm absolutely sure that the OpenSCAD2-language will also be a
programming language -- simply because it's necessary.

Of course, you can start with a reduced description-language without
variables, assignments, conditionals or loops; but then, I'm sure
these features would be added later, because they are necessary.
And then, you'll have a programming language...
(By the way, the same happened already to some template-engine-languages,
where the authors first thought that they don't need a programming-
language...)

I really like that OpenSCAD uses a functional programmming language,
although it's a bit unusual at the beginning, but as soon as you
understand the concept, it's fine.

And yes, it's unusual for beginners, which mostly think like procedural
languages and not like functional languages. ;) But this can be solved
by adding a procedural (or OO) language on top, which then creates
OpenSCAD-code.

If you want an OO-language for OpenSCAD2, how about Python? (Or better: Python3)
Python has a very readable syntax, is beginner-friendly, and has all
features you could need. The Python-program could then create OpenSCAD-code.
This way, you don't have to invent and implement a new language, you can
start step-by-step and directly test every feature, and test different
designs with minimal effort. When the design is fixed and tested, you
could still use a restricted Python-subset or even implement your own
parser, if you want to.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] feature request: offline documentation
Message-ID: <20150704073617.GA21780@localhost>

Hi,

I noticed that the help-menu in OpenSCAD (e.g. the cheatsheet and the
linked syntax-descriptions) always opens a website. So, without an
active internet-connection, it's not possible to look at the cheatsheet
or to look up some syntax.

I would suggest to include the documentation (at least the cheatsheet
and all linked pages) into the OpenSCAD-downloads, and then open these
local files from the help-menu, so that help works without internet.

The currently simplest way to achieve this would probably be to include
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Print_version
(incl. all images) and to include a modified cheatsheet which links
to the appropriate sections of this page.


best regards
Roland

Including the cheat-sheet should be relatively easy. That Print_version
of the manual looks hopelessly out of date though, so unless someone
finds the time to update it, it's probably not helpful to include that.
Also I'm not fond of having multiple places to update when something in
the manual changes (yes, the print version is basically just links to
the other articles, but still it violates the "dont-repeat-yourself"
principle which is usually a good thing, not only for code but also
for documentation).

I'm meaning to look at the Wikipedia export feature to maybe find a
way to automatically export the manual and create an offline version
(ideally in different formats like PDF and epub) from that, but so
far I'm not having time for that.

ciao,
   Torsten.

Well, I don't have "LOTS" of time, but I probably have more than most. I am
a retired programmer, and very interested in OpenSCAD.

I also, don't know what this entails.

But, can I help?

Cool. There's no manager standing around waving deadlines before

I only looked at what's possible in general, so there's probably
quite some investigation of details needed. But in my mind, that's
also part of the fun when working on new stuff.

Wikipedia allows the export of data via a simple interface
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Export

I guess this is basically intended to be the source for backups
and/or for transferring data from one installation to another.

There's big list of converters around, but I have no idea how
usable those are. Most seem to target the import into another wiki
software but some will convert to other file formats already.
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Alternative_parsers

For example it lists WikiPDF by Felipe Sanches who's even on the
list here, I think :-).

The manual export is easy, just go to

  https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Export

and enter "OpenSCAD_User_Manual" into the "Add pages from category".
This exports all the text content into one big XML file.

I think the ideal option would be an automated way to convert this
XML file into different formats. As first step, to make it usable
as off-line documentation, the target would probably be either
static HTML that could be shipped with OpenSCAD or maybe PDF.

I'm not sure if that needs actual programming to be done, or if
the existing tools are maybe already sufficient for that. So the
task could be one of

1) write a script that does all the conversion and image downloading

2) write a simple script to just run various existing tools

3) go though the wiki pages of the manual and adjust some of the
    text so it works nicely with some existing tool

4) something else I did not yet think of...

Ideally that should run on Linux so it could be integrated into
one of the automatic build servers (e.g. Travis). But I guess
a manual solution that is just started now an then would also
be a nice thing.

ciao,
   Torsten.

Message-ID: <1436028623162-13031.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi,

Am a complete novice to 3D Printing and am considering using OpenSCAD to
print some objects with an ABS structure & a 2 mm surface using Wood
filament. I have searched using the following words but with no success: '
abs structure wood surface ' & ' 2 head printing '

I have looked at the ' text_on_cube.scad ' example & assume that I could
cover the whole surface in a similar fashion. Would the resulting STL file
order the 2 headed printer to perform this task correctly and, on a
practical note, would the 'Wood' stick properly to the 'ABS' ?

Thanks for any constructive comments (+ve or -ve), Walter

No, that's not possible with a single STL file. That format does
not support multiple volumes that could be assigned to different
extruders.

Have a look at the slic3r documentation which gives some examples
of how to do that (common case is using 2 STL files with the separate
parts for each extruder).

Hmm, no idea about that. I think the Wood filament is based on PLA
so it might be tricky to get it to stick to ABS. But I've never
tried, so it's just guessing...

Hello Walter

From what I can see on the description of the "wood filament". It is 40% wood with a polymer filler.

> 
This wood-like filament is very unique. It allows you to capture the texture of nature in your printed models and is the perfect fit for your wood working project. Give it that extra something special. The material is 40% recycled wood and the remainder is a binding polymer.
Best printed at the PLA settings on your UP printer the material is still soft at the end of printing and it is recommended to let it cool before removing it from the perforated board.Once finished, it can be sanded and varnished too, just like normal wood. Low warp, good for printing large objects



Would this stick to ABS, most likely not. 

Options would be to divide your model into two sections and the print them separately.

You could then try and glue the two sections together with different glues looking for something that would bind the two materials together.

Thanks Torsten & Robert for your quick responses.

I had seen the slic3r.org reference in the online manual, although the 3D
Printer has not arrived yet, but had ordered ABS as opposed to PLA filament.
I will try it once I start printing and will let you know the result.
Possibly many holes/bumps in the ABS surface will help the binding.

Walter

I think that one reason I avoid Sweep is because there is no 
documentation that I can find, and the code has no comments at all. It 
may be obvious to some of you, but not to me.  It is pure majick.

For example, in sweep-path, a function f() is defined, which appears to 
define a path through 3D space.  Fine.  Why does the shape rotate as it 
is swept out?  What is controlling that?

I guess that the shape() is 2D (because it only has pairs of 
coordinates) but it is not in any format that I know about (no 
triangles, no faces).  How does it work?

Does it really have to be so obscure?

You actually left out a really good reason to invent a language:
notation. Most programming languages are designed to make a particular
approach or solution easier than in other languages. One way to make
things easier to solve and understand is notation.

In ancient Rome, large number multiplication was considered advanced
math. Roman numerals do not make multiplication easy. Changing to the
positional notation we now use, makes multiplication of arbitrary
numbers so easy we teach it in elementary school.

OpenSCAD is a notation for describing objects, it is not a general
purpose programming language.

Although it may not be your intent, several of your examples come
across as condescending or insulting. I might humbly suggest that you
first understand the reasons why the designers of OpernSCAD are doing
what they do before assuming that you know a better solution.

Hi Ben. Congratulations, you have managed to use my own words to completely
mischaracterize what my project is all about. Somehow, you managed to
ignore almost everything I wrote, quoted one sentence out of context, and
used it against me.

Also, I have to say that your vicious personal attacks against me go far
beyond anything I would have expected to read on the OpenSCAD forum. No, I
am not a psychopath. No, this project is not compensation for my small dick.

For everybody else, yes of course I understand that OpenSCAD is a
stateless, "functional" language, and that it is much easier to use than a
general purpose programming language. My design document actually states
both of these things as design goals.

The wiki example here
<https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/First_Steps/Opening_an_existing_example_model>  
does not match example004.scad, missing the translate & cylinder.

As the wiki has a graphic with the cylinder, perhaps the extra two lines
should be added to the distributed example004.scad (and its new name if it
made it to the new examples structure)?

Using a general purpose language is great in the academic world, but not the
efficient way to address a specific problem. I have spent some 50 years
creating specific solutions where the general purpose solution was much
slower, sometime by a factor of 100.

Keep up your good work and don't let the C/C+ freaks distract you.

In the meantime you can clean up the picture by have the cylinder protrude
beyond the the cube on both sides.

difference () {
    cube([3,60,60]);

    translate([-1,30,30])
        rotate([0,90,0])
            cylinder(r=15,h=5);
}

Just as you would do if making the hole with you drill press, going past to
make a clean hole.

I've simply removed the reference to the example004 filename. I think it

I am thinking the ideal solution would be to have one source (html), that
can be used for both online and offline documentation. And if the html
"shipped" with the application, then the help from the application (would
default to the offline version).

Right, that's another option. It has one big drawback though. As the
current manual is a Wiki, it's very easy to contribute to the documentation.

Having it on github or so might create an additional barrier to just fix
something or include additional info in the documentation.

I'm not sure which way is going to be better in the long run, but I do
fear losing contributions by people who don't want to bother with github.

You don't need to move the manual to github.

I just tried this using Google Chrome: navigate to
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual, then "Save as complete
web page". This created OpenSCAD.html and an OpenSCAD directory, containing
the complete user manual in HTML. I can open OpenSCAD.html from my local
hard drive using a web browser, and I get the user manual.

If we can find a tool that does this from the command line, then we can add
this command to the build process.

The Print_version puts the entire User Manual onto a single HTML web page.
This is good as an intermediate step towards creating a PDF file. I'm not
the sort of person who would print the User Manual, but I suppose we should
support this use case. Maybe we can find a shell command for generating a
PDF file from
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Print_version and put
that in the OpenSCAD build process.

However, if I am browsing the user manual interactively, using my laptop,
then I certainly don't want the PDF version, I prefer HTML. Then I can
follow links, I can open different sections in different tabs, there are no
page breaks to navigate past, and so on. If I am browsing HTML, then it is
not obvious that I want the entire User Manual on a single page. Isn't it
more pleasant to browse a web of interconnected documents?

"Save as Complete Web Page" would only work from the "Print_version"
page... it downloads the one page you're looking at, including images, etc
on that page, but it will still contain links to other pages which won't be
downloaded. When I tried it, there were also still numerous links to images
which didn't download... probably due to security settings in my browser or
something like that.

I've tested the procedure that I described, and it works for me. I'm using
Chrome on MacOS.

We still need a platform independent and reliable way to do this from the
command line, in order to integrate it into the build as I suggested. I
figure that "wget -r" will probably work. I'll try testing that later this
evening.

In my view the output of this is not looking nice enough to count as official
documentation shipped with OpenSCAD.

Yes the text content is all there, but most of the images seem to be broken
as they still link to the online version and there are some links that are
already broken in the Print_version page. And all the navigation boxes
scattered around in the text do not make it very appealing to read.

Also there is still the issue that the Print_version is not maintained, try
searching for "list comprehensions" or "text()".
That's fixable of cause, but every change in topics/pages in the main document
will break the print version again.

ciao,
   Torsten.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Working on SpacePilot support, need help with rotation
Message-ID: <09acba11075d3026b2b581409bf1bb9b@durkon.lan>

Hi everyone!

I recently got a 3Dconnexion SpacePilot (the older version, not the Pro 
version) from Ebay, and I really like it.
I'm trying to add support for it to OpenSCAD (via the spacenav library), 
but the gimbal rotation stuff is giving me a bit of a headache.
So if anyone could help me out here, that would be greatly appreciated!
I'll attach what I have so far; the interesting part is in 
QGLView::rotate2().

Have fun,
Gert

wget -r -k does not work.

I have done some searching and maybe httrack (http://www.httrack.com/) will
work.

What I'm proposing is a shell script that recursively downloads the User
Manual HTML and all its dependencies. There are lots of open source tools
for doing this, we just need to pick one that works for us. If there are
broken images, then that's just a bug in the shell script that would have
to be fixed.

The navigation bars are all wrapped in DIV elements with CSS IDs and
CLASSes, so they can be hidden by adding a few lines of CSS to the
appropriate file.

I don't have the shell script right now, but it seems like something that
would be easy for me to write.

httrack might work to get all web pages, but they might come across as
markdown. if so, I think pandoc can be used to convert to html.

so maybe a combination of the two might be in order.

this is the bad about markdown sites. the good is obvious.

httrack seems to have all the right features. Good find.

Can you describe the problem with a bit more detail? Gimbal lock
always is a problem with 3 axis rotation. One of the options to
prevent this is to use quaternions for the calculation I think.

Some other notes...

The class name MainWindow is a bit misleading. There are multiple
instances when more than one document is open. Having the event
loop for every instance might not be ideal (in case the library
supports multiple open calls at all).

Calling updateGL() in a timer is going to kill performance for
every non-trivial model. There is already quite a big issue with
render performance due to the legacy OpenGL code.

To get the code included in the official release it would need
to be separated (new driver class maybe?) as there seems to be
no Windows or OSX version of the library yet.

ciao,
   Torsten.

Hi Torsten,

 thank you for the quick answer.

I am looking for a function
 _f(current_camera_rotation, rotation_values_from_input) ->
new_camera_rotation_
 that always does what the user expects, regardless of the current
orientation of the object.
 (I would like to mimic the behavior of FreeCAD. Blender does it
differently and it's fun to switch between the two, but that's another
story. :-))

 When I ignore y and z,
 cam.object_rot.x() += x;
 does exactly what I would expect: Tilting the controller around the x
axis rotates the object around an axis that is parallel to the camera's
x axis.
 That is because X is the "outer ring" of the gimbal. Right?
 But,
 cam.object_rot.z() += z;
 Always rotates around the object's Z axis, which may or may not be
parallel to the camera's Z axis. And the Y axis does something in
between.

 I tried to compensate for the effects of the x-rotation for y and z:
 double rx = x;
 double ry = -cos(cam.object_rot.x()/180.*M_PI)*y +
sin(cam.object_rot.x()/180.*M_PI)*z;
 double rz = sin(cam.object_rot.x()/180.*M_PI)*y +
cos(cam.object_rot.x()/180.*M_PI)*z;
 but that does not cover all possible cases, and you can rotate the
object into a position where tilting the controller around the Z axis
actually rotates the object around an axis parallel to the camera's X,
not Z.

 I imagine it might help to convert the gimbal angles to some kind of
rotation matrix, update the matrix according to the input values, and
convert it back to gimbal angles. That way you probably would not have
to worry about gimbal lock either.
 I am not familiar with quaternions and I'm a bit embarrassed to say
that my linear algebra is quite rusty these days, so they might be
exactly what I described, but maybe not.

Good point. I'll look into that.

Ah, you are right. The timer only calls QGLView::rotate (and translate),
which in turn calls updateGL(), when there's actually a movement event
from the controller. However, there is indeed no need to call updateGL()
again in the timer. I'll remove that.

I agree. I'm was wondering what would be a good way to detect the
spacenav library at compile time and only activate the code when the lib
is actually available. I just tried
 exists("/usr/include/spnav.h") | exists("/usr/local/include/spnav.h") {
 message("spacenav found")
 DEFINES += SPACENAV
 }
 in the openscad.pro file, and it works, but it's not particularly
elegant... Can I tell qmake to check for a file in INCLUDEPATH?
 Also, suppose someone who has the spacenav header installed wants to
compile a version without spacenav support (i.E. for distribution), how
can I account for that? I don't know much about autoconf/automake (and I
believe this makes me a happier person), but I guess I am looking for
the qmake-equivalent of ./configure --without-spacenav here. Any ideas?

I know what you mean about not getting credit for what you did way back then.
No one remembers that I was the first one outside of Dartmouth to write a
BASIC compiler. It was a one pass compiler for the SDS 940 which fit in 2K
(24 bit) words of read only memory. When IBM later wrote their version, it
used over 100K words.

Can I interject a thought regarding the discussion regarding documentation?

I'm using Debian Linux and they're about 2 light years behind in their
version of OpenScad. I realize that the people now working on methods to
improve distributing documentation cannot go back but, I think that having the
appropriate documentation for the release you have, distributed with
the OpenScad distribution itself, is desirable.

If someone wants to peruse features available  on newer releases they
can download from or read on the Wiki.

In principle, versioned documentation is a good idea. I wonder if we can
support that in our process.

If we are going to continue with making the documentation wiki-editable,
then we would need to version the documentation in the wiki. Which sounds
good, since the current user manual is cluttered with references to
obsolete features, and "this only works in version X" annotations. If the
pace of innovation picks up, or as time goes on, the clutter gets worse.

But, we'll need to clone the entire user manual at each release, on the
wiki. The downside is that edits to one version of the user manual aren't
automatically propagated to other versions. Somebody would have to
periodically review edits to each version and decide whether to propagate
those edits to other versions. Who will do this? Or maybe old versions of
the user manual are frozen and made non-editable? Maybe we can generate
versions of the user manual for older releases by retrieving versions from
the wiki history? Again, who will volunteer to do this?

The current user manual is currently missing important information. It
doesn't document user defined functions, or the new text feature. So we
certainly could be maintaining it a lot better.

The clutter gets worse if it's not maintained. That's not really related
to the technical solution but the time spend on the documentation.

What obsolete features are still in there? If you have a pointer to that,
I'll try to clean that up.

That would be a nice and clean solution, but I think that would only
work if there's a documentation team of multiple people working on that
as Wikibooks does not seem to support versioning. Doing all that manually
is going to be a huge amount of work. I don't see that currently so I'd
suggest to not make it very complicated and live with some of drawbacks
(e.g. some of the "this needs version xxxx" markers).

Wikibooks already has the normal review stuff where someone needs to
accept changes. I do have the Reviewer role now so I'm going though
the changes from time to time (there are others helping with that too).
But of cause that's not really related to OpenSCAD versions.
Apart from that "reviewed" state I've not yet seen a way to freeze
some content.

One possible solution to keep the docs maintained and up to date is to
keep the documentation where the code is.

Is put linear_extrude() doc in the very same file where the logic is
defined. Whenever someone changes/add/removes a feature, they are
supposed to change the doc in the same file and the same PR (and even
better in the same commit).

Than, for any version, related documentation can be exported.

The downside is, it would no longer be so easy to contribute to do the
documentation, as it is on the wiki now.

Yes, for technical docs that's perfect, although it's currently
not really done. I don't see how that would work for the user
documentation which is not related to some specific source file
or function and also includes images.

Yep, right now I don't see how we could get this in an easy
way with Wikibooks, it would be easy with the documentation
stored in the git repo, but...

...this downside is much bigger in my opinion than the technical
benefits github can give. Having written some (small) parts of
the manual for the stuff I've implemented, I really value the
contributions that are coming in on the Wiki pages, even the
tiny ones that are just adding a note to clarify special cases
or tidy up the language.

Recently I bought a new 3Dconnexion SpaceNavigator to use with OpenSCAD

So do I. As Torsten mentioned already: There may be multiple instances
of the class MainWindow. So you can not put the device interaction into
it. I implemented a small class that cares about the USB IO and emits
translate, rotate and button event signals. There is only one instance
of this USB IO class. (Maybe I should make it a singleton.) The
MainWindow instances then connect slots to those signals.

> (via the spacenav library),
I had a look into the spacenav library too. But it is more or less Linux
only. And, as far as I see it, it can not coexist with the 3Dconnexion
drivers. This is not acceptable for me on MacOS. The best way would be
to use the API of 3Dconnexion. But the license of the API is prohibitive
for Free- / Open Source Software. So I interface to the USB device
directly, reading and interpreting the USB HID reports. This proved to
be quite simple using the HIDAPI library. The later has the advantage of
multi platform support.

You can see my USB IO test code here:
http://forum.openscad.org/Need-help-to-support-3Dconnexion-SpaceNavigator-tp12962.html
It is written on MacOS. I tested it on Linux (Debian, using
hidapi-libusb) and it worked. Maybe you can give it a try with your device.

> but the gimbal rotation stuff is giving me a bit of a headache.
Same for me.

Attached is the current state of my hack. You need to drop in hid.c for
your platform from hidapi in additoin to the patch.

https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Text

https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/User-Defined_Functions

-----------------
This nothing to do with a "separate Print_version".

The OpenSCAD user manual is located here:
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual

As far as I have always known, that *is* the user manual.
Now you are showing me links to apparently secret parts of the user manual
that document text and user defined functions.
How does a user discover these links, since they are not referenced by the
user manual?

Maybe the answer to that isn't important.
The user manual should be updated so that it links to all of the sections
in the user manual.
Since user defined functions and text are part of the language, these
sections should be linked to by:
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language

I have no idea what's going on then. Those links are not
secret, and I see both on the main page (List-Comprehensions
is 3.6 and Text is 4.2.) even when not logged into Wikibooks.

There could be a difference if something new is added as I
think it defaults to the reviewed version but in that case
an additional bar in the top mentions there are pending
changes (which is currently not the case for the main page).

This is the approach that I like. My lib OpenScad_DocTest (see links in the
signature) is an attempt to make in-file docs (and tests) possible  

But I can picture that it won't be popular  'cos jamming codes with full
docs doesn't seem to be a common practice.

I had a look into this before I started. Unfortunately none of this is
really usable. Linux only, X11 only, outdated, can not coexist with the
3Dconnexion drivers, unacceptable license, ...

A direct USB interface with HIDAPI can coexist with the 3Dconnexion
drivers and is platform independent. But it probably has to deal with
differences among devices. Also note that the code to interpret the HID
reports from the SpaceNavigator is trivial. (See my demo code.)

Agreed. Unfortunately Qt doesn't know anything about 6dof devices. There
is no generic support infrastructure like for 2D rodents.
http://www.codegardening.com/2011/02/using-3dconnexion-mouse-with-qt.html
"Qt has no corresponding Qt events for the 3D mouse"

As far as I read X11 has some generic multi-axis support, but not
Windows nor MacOS.

I know. According to my research FreeCAD does it "by hand" too. It uses
different interfaces depending on platform:
http://lists.qt-project.org/pipermail/interest/2015-April/016309.html
says: "Freecad can use either proprietary SDK (Windows and Mac) or
libspnav (X11)"
and does its own event processing.

Okay, now I see the link to User-Defined Functions at 3.12.

What has always messed me up in the past is that I never read that table of
contents, I have always clicked on "3. The OpenSCAD Language", which opens
a document which has its own table of contents, which is missing
user-defined functions. I never realized that those two tables-of-contents
were out of sync.

And yeah, now I see the link to Text in 4.2. I had always skipped past that
section, assuming it was tutorial information that expanded on the language
reference manual stuff in "3. The OpenSCAD Language". Now I see that the 2D
primitives are missing from section 3. Weird. I've used circle, square and
linear_extrude, but I've never seen the documentation for it before.

So it's mental blindness on my part, assuming that the documentation had a
structure which it doesn't have. I thought the tables of contents were in
sync across levels, and that section 3 documented the entire language.

People who are good at writing documentation are often not the same people
who are good at writing C++ code.

That said, I'll also note that I'm maintaining all the documentation for
OpenSCAD2 in a github repository. Not in the repo's wiki, but in the repo
itself. I can totally use a web browser for editing all of the
documentation, pretty much the same thing as using a wiki.

I think the main issue is just that repos have a different model for
permissions than a wiki. It's not enough to have a github login, you also
need permission from the repo owner before you can directly edit
documentation in a repo. Otherwise, your only option is to fork the repo,
make changes, and submit a pull request, which is way more complicated and
bureaucratic than editing a wiki. It's a bit much to impose that kind of
process on the people who are good at writing documentation.

Hi Doug:

> support that in our process.

Re-thinking ... as most users and potential users want to be with the
latest version I'm thinking forget versioning, past is past and users should
be able to figure out on their own if a newer feature then they have is
used in an example. 
  
I'm willing to try and help, the problem is I'm pushing 80 and don't know
how long I'll be able to help. I've been using Unix/Linux since the '80s
so I have skills there that might help in organizing things. I downloaded

The people who have contributed to date have done a good job but, as you 
note the pace has picked up and likely will at an increased pace for some
time. It might be simpler to list available and obsolete features in
tabular form. If you think I can be helpful give me a shout, I've done
dirty work many times in my life.<smile>

Hi Jochen,

great to see that someone else is working on the same thing too.
I won't be able to work on this until I get home next week, but then 
I'll definately have a look at your driver then.

Sounds good!

Huh. Whithout having looked at the code, I see no reason why it could 
not coexist with the 3Dconnexion driver - *IF* you switch off the X11 
event stuff that's mainly there for 3Dconnexion compatibility anyway. 
I'm currently connecting to spacenavd via unix socket. I just have to 
make sure that X11 does not try to use it as a regular mouse too, and 
that I ignore all motion events when my window is not active.
But, assuming spacenavd cannot coexist with the 3Dconnexion driver, your 
approach seems to be the best solution.
(Well, actually, fixing spacenavd would be the best solution, but I have 
no idea how easy that would be.)

That's so sad and stupid. But then again, the 3Dconnexion drivers are 
only available for a very limited number of platforms, and only 
maintained for a limited time anyway. (I also have an old Labtec 
Spaceball 4000 which still works fine with a RS232/USB adapter and 
spacenavd. Even on my Raspberry Pi, if I wanted to. :-) )
(BTW: Doesn't FreeCAD use the proprietary drivers on Windows and OSX?)

I will!

The hack I have at the moment does work moderately well, but I'm still 
trying to figure out how to do it completely right.

Thanks!
I will give it a try when I'm back home next week.

I'll attach the current state of my patch too, in case you're interested 
in the rotation stuff (even though it's not perfect yet).

There is a way in wiki to replicate the content in an article inline
another. I came across it a while ago, so will have to look for it again.
That way, things like the other pages which are not updated could be changed
to drag in the main text from the main page rather than having a dup which
is out of date.

yeah, I'm pushing 70 myself. Been using unix/bsd since the early 80's.
linux since like 92.

I am willing to help in any way possible too. I only do ruby/python
programming anymore. I haven't used C since early 90's. I like wiki's as
they make documentation more collaboritive, but it can easily get "out of
hand", and something that seems simple, like offline doc, and versioning
with a wiki is much less easy.

I wonder if there are other wiki's out there that would be better suited to
what we want to do?

I took the time to make a script that seems to download the entire doc
successfully. Give me a day or two to fine-tune it and I'll share.

I'm counting: 97 pages, 103 images, total 138.6 GB

I don't think we want to distribute 130 odd GB with the installation.
Presumably that is mostly images which won't compress well.

dunno how it works on Linux but on win it seems to talk to spacepilot on 
the level "below" regular driver api... I have the spacepilot (the one 
HP was selling, not the spacey round new one) and for e.g. freecad don't 
see any buttons, only the navigation thingy ... and any settings you 
make in driver (sensitivity etc) is completely ignored by the freecad. I 
got the dev pack for windows from the 3dconnexion and wanted to add 
support for it to the openscad, just I got the dev pack only recently so 
not yet even looked at it let alone tried to add support into openscad 
:D ..

That seems kinda high to me.

I have a lot of jpg's and the biggest ones are about 1 Mb each. Most are
less than that.
I would think from the size of things 130 MB would have been more like it.

Sincerely apology to readers for my mistake --- was half sleep in the
midnight when I posted the previous one.

It should have been  *1.8 MB in pages*, and *1.4 MB in images*. 

The previously  reported "138.6 GB" is the free space in my HD ...

With the ridiculous license for the official SDK, there is no legal
way to distribute an OpenSCAD version using that SDK (I'm assuming
part of the SDK will be linked to the applciation). You could build
a version for your own personal use, but as there are other options
and people are working on that, I guess it makes more sense to pick
one of those.

ciao,
  Torsten.

I was not reading the license details (as I said, just got the files 
recently and some work came and...) but I heard that before... now it is 
probably possible to create a wrapper and allow a blob with their sdk to 
be downloaded as part of non-open lib usable by openscad .. donno, will 
look at it as soon as I have time, missing support for this pilot is a 
fairly big issue for me .. so even making patch that works "just for me" 
will "work for me" initially ...

otoh making "interface" in the openscad to allow external manipulation 
of the 3d object would probably be a good thing irrelevant to the pilot 
as then you can easily add support to rotate object controlled by 
wiiiiii camera and ir markers on fingers or any other contraption we can 
create :D .. so then when openscad export the interface for object 
manipulation, we can create completely independent apps that talk to it 
and move/rotate object :) ... i will probably try to solve "my problem" 
this way.. it's just .. time ..

again, I just posted to say freescad is IMO not using the driver but 
talks directly with the pilot since anything set in driver is ignored 
and not everything is recognized properly (probably they test with that 
aerodynamic version of pilot :D ) .. the "other" thing I wanted to make 
myself with - if I make it and it's good enough I share it, if I don't 
make it .. well what the hack, would not be the first time :D

No, wrappers don't fix license violations.

Sure, no problem as long as it's not distributed, that's fine.

With multiple people working on getting it to work, I do hope at
least some basic support is not that far away.

Yeah, that could be useful for a number of cases. It might not be
easy to find an interface that makes everybody happy, but I like
the idea :)

The driver / daemon jumps on the device and programs it. E.g. setting
the speed / acceleration, tuning the LED on/off, programming the LCD...
When the 3Dconnexion driver and spacenavd try to do this at the same
time I expect to get a confused device.

Something I thought about too. If the client library of spacenavd could
talk to either its own spacenavd or the proprietary 3Dconnexion driver
on all platforms, it would solve all problems. Unfortunately spacenavd
isn't there at the moment. But direct USB HID access turned out to be
that easy that I postponed spacenavd. For now I have enough to do inside
OpenSCAD. Once that is sorted out I may return to the USB HID versus
spacenavd problem.

Seconded. Maybe it is best to support spacenavd and direct USB HID
access. There should be no problem for OpenSCAD to use both at the same
time. If you have a newish USB HID install the 3Dconnexion driver and
use the USB direct route. If you have an old (serial) device install
spacenavd instead and be happy. OpenSCAD can probe both interfaces and
use what ever it finds. It is just a matter of trying spnav_open() and
hid_open() until one succeeds, then divert into the suitable subroutine
to do the rest.

> (BTW: Doesn't FreeCAD use the proprietary drivers on Windows and OSX?)
AFAIK only on Windows. I tried on MacOS and FreeCAD did not react to the
Space Navigator.

I thought about that too. I have some experience with DBus. Adding a
DBus RPC interface to control translation / rotation from outside should
not be that hard. (Once the SpaceNavigator stuff is done. Some parts of
the two problems overlap.) Then you'd need an extra program / process
that fills the gap between the 3dconnexion API and the DBus API of
OpenSCAD. You would have to distribute this as binary only. As it is a
separate process it would not infect OpenSCAD with any poisonous license.

But this would be overcomplicated, IMHO. Talking to the USB HID directly
proved to be simple and is much more efficient.

Why I think it is a good idea is because it seems that different 3dconn. 
devices have slightly different protocol so supporting them all is going 
to be pita ..  otoh with the interface supporting "any" device gets 
pretty simple

Just finished a script that allows users to download the entire documentation

It is possible to :

1) Write a shell script to zip the folder
2) Use a cron job to download and zip it nightly
3) Then put it in the main repo.

This way, the wiki page becomes the only source of doc we need to maintain.

It is a user space function, not part of OpenSCAD. Hopefully the author may
be listening...

No, generally over my head, I have to look at it carefully.

Got me. I suspect tangent_path() is involved.

Yes it is a 2D shape. Note line 36 `shape3d = to_3d(shape);` in sweep.scad -
I have not looked at to_3D yet.

But note polygon just takes a list of points, path is optional if the points
are in order.

> Does it really have to be so obscure?

I suppose it could use some comments, but it is user content. So enjoy what
you have ??

Forgot to mention: I have an old SpaceBall 2003. I used it with my SGIs.
But I never run more then the SGI confidence tests. I should dig it out
and see if I can get it to work with spacenavd. But IIRC it didn't work
anymore when I tried it last time, several years ago... Ahhh, I also
have the buttons and dials boxes... :-)

Attached is my current state of the affair. I moved the event handling
into class QGLView and I handle translate / rotate in separate methods
like you. I switched from signals for event delivery to QEvent
subclasses. This makes it easy to deliver events to the in-focus window
only. See SpaceNav::Impl::operator()( void). It should be easy to modify
for spacenavd.

The button handling needs a bit work. I noticed that this is slightly
different on MacOS compared to Linux and NetBSD. Maybe because the
3Dconnexion driver reprograms the device on MacOS...

The rotation problem is still unresolved.

Nice, I'll try to provide some simple framework allowing different
driver types. Maybe the events could be renamed to a more general
name to be used by other implementations too.

I've attached the hidapi.pri I'm using for testing. At least on
Debian, hidapi comes with pkg-config support. This should work on
Linux and MacOS (tested only on my Debian system so far). Windows
builds use the MXE cross build environment which does not seem to
have hidapi, but that should be easy to solve by either adding it
to MXE or including the two files directly. Good thing is MXE has
libusb already.

To use hidapi.pri, it needs to be added to (similar to harfbuzz)

openscad.pro:CONFIG += hidapi

common.pri:include(hidapi.pri)

ciao,
   Torsten.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Rods between 3D points
Message-ID: <CAJbtQC9=pSchrwzsFJRcVOj7zgSNr77o=9JMBESc6tBxV40fOQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to construct a model where I have a set of 3D points, and I want
to create "rods" connecting certain pairs of these points, where a "rod" is
cylinder connecting the points, capped with hemispheres.

This brute force solution works:

    module rod(a, b, r) {
        hull() {
            translate(a) sphere(r);
            translate(b) sphere(r);
        }
    }

but it's *really* slow for high values of $fn if I have a bunch of these
rods.

I was thinking that I could do something like this instead:

    module rod(a, b, r) {
        rotate([?,?,?]) translate(a) union() {
            sphere(r);
            cylinder(r=thickness, h=h);
            translate([0,0,h]) sphere(r);
        }
        h = norm(a-b);
    }

which should be much faster, but before I try to work out the trig for that
rotation, I'm wondering if there's an existing solution to "generate a rod
between two points" or to "create a rotation that points z in the direction
of a vector".

I've had this problem myself when trying to make my own path extrude
function:

http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:186660

The problem is that the manipulations you make to rotate the 2D object
around in 3D space will frequently also induce a rotation of the object.
It's not immediately obvious how to alter the initial rotation of the
object to get it to have the least amount of warping when extruding a
path.

When I've tried to have a look at the issue further, I get the feeling
that this rotation is dependent on prior and future states. In other
words, it's context sensitive; it doesn't seem possible to determine the
best initial rotation given just a start state and a position in 3D space.

Realistically there are only two alternatives: Raw USB access (via
HIDAPI) or spacenavd. They can coexist and it seems there is no need for
runtime configuration to switch between those two. Detection can be
automatic. You probably wane compile time switches to disable one or
both options. I'll have a look at spacenavd later. The only Space
Navigator / HIDAPI specific parts are in SpaceNav::Impl::operator(). It
should be simple to add support for spacenavd.

There are more things to do. We want a configuration menu to assign
different functions to the buttons of the device. Probably we want a
local speed setting. I can't help much here as I have no clue about Qt
GUI programming. (And I am not much interested to gain that skill. I am
fine with "reconfiguration by recompilation". ;-) )

Depending how things work out it may be necessary to add some device
description. I.e. a way to determine the total number of buttons of the
currently connected device, nim. / max. axis scaling factor, ... For now
I avoided this, there are more basic things to do for now.

The SpaceNav classes could be renamed to e.g. SixDoFDev (Six Dimensions
of Freedom Device) or the like. They are not Space Navigator specific.

Thanks for the help. I plan to do some testing on Debian. But I have to
install it on my old laptop first... This way I can build an interface
to spacenavd based on Gerts work.

I haven't used it since 1993 and don't plan to change this in the near
future. So I can't provide much help in that department. ;-)

Hi,

yes, there is: multmatrix().
With multmatrix(), you can use a 4x4 transformation-matrix, and don't
need to play with rotate and angles. It takes some time to understand
transformation-matrices, but it's a lot easier afterwards.


In more detail:

multmatrix() uses a matrix-vector-multiplication for
coordinate-transformation, so:
[new_x]   [u0 v2 w0 t0]   [x]
[new_y] = [u1 v1 w1 t1] * [y]
[new_z]   [u2 v0 w2 t2]   [z]
[1]       [0  0  0  1]    [1]

All this does is:
- translate by t
- transform (rotate, stretch, shear, mirror), so that
  - the new x-axis points to u (so, [1,0,0] is transformed to [u0,u1,u2])
  - the new y-axis points to v (so, [0,1,0] is transformed to [v0,v1,v2])
  - the new z-axis points to w (so, [0,0,1] is transformed to [w0,w1,w2])

So, you need to determine u,v and w:

- w / z-axis:
  In OpenSCAD, a cylinder is created in z-direction, so it goes from [0,0,0]
  to [0,0,h]. But you want it to go from [0,0,0] to (b-a). So, you already
  know the new z-axis:
  w = (b-a) / norm(b-a). 

  So, if you use:
  [new_x]   [1  0 (b-a)[0] a0]   [x]
  [new_y] = [0  1 (b-a)[1] a1] * [y]
  [new_z]   [0  0 (b-a)[2] a2]   [z]
  [1]       [0  0  0       1]    [1]
  your cylinder would already point into the correct direction
  (but wouldn't be a real cylinder anymore).

- u / x-axis: The new x-axis must be perpendicular to the new z-axis;
  otherwise the cylinder wouldn't look like a cylinder. For simplicity,
  we chose that it should also be perpendicular to the old z-axis.
  So, we need the cross-product of the old and the new z-axis:
  u = cross(w, [0,0,1]) / norm(w, [0,0,1])

- v / y-axis: The new y-axis must be perpendicular to the new x- and
  the new z-axis. So, we can again use the cross-product:
  v = cross(w, u) / norm(w, u)

That's it.


So, in OpenSCAD:

module rod(a, b, r) {
    translate(a) sphere(r=r);
    translate(b) sphere(r=r);

    dir = b-a;
    h   = norm(dir);
    if(dir[0] == 0 && dir[1] == 0) {
        // no transformation necessary
        cylinder(r=r, h=h);
    }
    else {
        w  = dir / h;
        u0 = cross(w, [0,0,1]);
        u  = u0 / norm(u0);
        v0 = cross(w, u);
        v  = v0 / norm(v0);
        multmatrix(m=[[u[0], v[0], w[0], a[0]],
                      [u[1], v[1], w[1], a[1]],
                      [u[2], v[2], w[2], a[2]],
                      [0,    0,    0,    1]])
        cylinder(r=r, h=h);
    }
}


enjoy,
Roland

For the Space Navigator devices that's probably the case, but
there are other devices that could be used as well like joysticks,
the remote interface discussed lately or maybe there are other
3d mouse devices with more reasonable licensed SDKs.
No need for something hugely complicated, the event stuff you
wrote covers probably already quite a big part of it.

I think it makes sense to first get things working with same
sane default settings and add config options in the next step.

Well, I'm not using it either except for testing. The number of
OpenSCAD users running the Windows version is quite large though,
so it does matter a lot. No need to worry, I'll try to take care
of that part (even if a bit grumpily ;-).

Message-ID: <1436481535106-13110.post@n5.nabble.com>

About the issue of *twisting during sweeping*: 

The way I approach this is not to calc points independently, but calc them
by projecting points of previous frame onto the plane at the current point.

Approaches:

1) Calc angle-bisect Point, *Pb*:

For each point i, *P*(i), we have a *pqr*= [ *P*(i-1), *P*(i), *P*(i+1) ]
and the angle *A*(i) of *P*(i). Calc the angle bisect point *Pb* using
*pqr*, such that line [ *P*(i), *Pb* ] divides *A*(i) equally;

2) Make the projection plane at i:

Calc the point *N* such that line [ *P*(i),*N* ] is the normal of [
*P*(i-1), *P*(i), *Pb* ]. The plane, *S*=[ *P*(i), *N*, *Pb* ], the plane
that cuts angle *A*(i) in half, will be the target plane to which we project
previous frame. 

3) Projection:

Retrieve points from the previous frame and project them along the line [
*P*(i-1), *P*(i) ] onto *S*. 

Thus, we will have an array *Fs*= [ frame0, frame1, frame2 ...]

4) Join frames together to make it: *pts*= [ P0, P1, P2 ...] 

5) Generate faces using the faces() function described in  faces
<http://forum.openscad.org/A-faces-function-for-simple-polyhedrons-td12809.html> 
: 

    *f*=faces( "chain", nside= len(*Fs*[0]), nseg= len(*Fs*)-1 );

6) And simply, polyhedron( points=*pts*, faces=*f* );

So far it seems to work well. Throwing in any random 3D line and it can
produce sweeping nicely without the problem of twisting. 

In fact, you can actually apply the twisting of your choice, by modifying
steps of projection.

The following is the "chain" example on my post about  faces
<http://forum.openscad.org/A-faces-function-for-simple-polyhedrons-td12809.html> 
:

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n12809/demo_chain.png> 

Or I can generate more examples if interested.

Oh good, I was lurking while waiting for a Windows mention.
If there is a commitment (obviously no absolutes) to getting it working, I'm
happy to buy one and help with testing.

> I'm trying to construct a model where I have a set of 3D points, and I want to create "rods" connecting certain pairs of these points

Here's how I've done it in the past. This draws a cylinder centred at the midpoint of p1 and p2, rotated so that its [previously vertical]
extrusion axis is between the points.

module drawRay(p1,p2,tk){ // draw ray between 2 specified points
  translate((p1+p2)/2)
    rotate([-acos((p2[2]-p1[2]) / norm(p1-p2)),0,
            -atan2(p2[0]-p1[0],p2[1]-p1[1])])
       cylinder(r1=tk, r2=tk*0.5, h=norm(p1-p2), $fn = 6, center = true);
}

p1, p2: source and target point respectively
tk: thickness of cylinder

* Change $fn to something higher to make a smoother cylinder
* Delete "r2=..." to have a constant thickness of cylinder
* Add additional "sphere" definitions at each point if you want rounded edges.

If this works, and I will check if it does a little later.
If it does, and includes the cheat sheet, then maybe a future version of
openscad could have an optional Environment Variable to point to the
docroot (like file:///blahblah/), or if no env variable found, what it
points to now.

The scraped HTML would need quite some additional clean-up

* it fires of a number of JavaScripts that access the Wikibooks site
* all the CSS files are loaded online
* most of the images don't work (at least in Firefox) as they have a
   srcset attribute (which I did not even know until just now)
* the index looks strange due to missing SVG files
* the chapter links into other pages don't work
* the edit links are displayed as []

I guess all that is fixable, but I do wonder how much of a moving
target this is chasing as it's trying to handle the output of
another generator which could change with every Wikimedia release.
It might still be a good idea to at least have a look at the
export option and render the original data.

But then if the script is maintained and updated to follow the
changes, that might not be a huge issue.

ciao,
   Torsten.

Where are index and chapter links ? Maybe because thatI have 
css files linked to the web(which should be fixed) so that I don't
see any problem ?

I think before we figure out a better way to solve the burden of
having to maintain several sources of doc, this might serve as
a temporary solution.

Btw, the [edit] => [] is intentional. I figure that there's no point of
editing an offline wiki doc ('cos it needs wiki's editing feature) so I
remove the word "edit".

I mean the file://document#chapter links. The #chapter part seems
to be missing everywhere (maybe due to the link rewriting?)

Example:

file://.../openscad_docs/OpenSCAD_User_Manual

3.2 Primitive Solids - cube, sphere, cylinder & polyhedron

The "cylinder" link should go to Primitive_Solids#cylinder to
jump directly into that chapter.

Ah, all the remaining [] looked a bit strange. If it's easy, it
would look better if those are removed completely. But that's
just minor cosmetics.

Talking cosmetics... :-) is it possible to add .html to the
files? It seems to work fine without, though.

I agree, it's much better than having different sources and it's
the only working solution to get a usable off-line documentation
right now.

Reading https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reusing_Wikipedia_content
it looks like the footer should also be extended a bit to clarify
the license. I currently think it's best to use the CC-BY-SA, but
I'll have a look at the GNU-FDL too.
Using CC-BY-SA would mean to also add a license link and a short
info that the content was modified (maybe something like "page
modified for off-line reading" is sufficient?).

ciao,
   Torsten.

I am a hobbyist wanting to print gears for gizmos.  The involute_gears

Thanks for writing this documentation, it was educational for me.

One comment so far:

	   Standard practice is circular_pitch = pi / diametral_pitch (See
the next parameter).
	   But for murky historical reasons,  the gear() code defines
circular_pitch = 180 / diametral_pitch.

Note that pi radians == 180 degrees, and that OpenSCAD uses degrees,
instead of radians, in its trigonometric functions.

I think this documentation should be placed in involute_gears.scad itself.
The source code on github is
https://github.com/openscad/MCAD/blob/master/involute_gears.scad

great doc. I wonder if it could be put in a libre office document, with
pictures to show what the various parts are; visuals are so much more
effective.

thanks.

I'd like to ask if it could be added to the MCAD page on the Wiki.
This page is really in need of some love and it looks like the
gear scripts are likely the most used part of MCAD.

https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/MCAD

Or, maybe even better as Doug suggested it could be added to the

Loong Jin, what do you think?

Lets first put it on the wiki, so we all can make miner correction easily,
and expand it a little.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] request for relative_extrude
Message-ID: <1436755178978-13128.post@n5.nabble.com>

The current linear_extrude works well but cannot make objects that taper or
do certain kinds of rotation or translation effects.
My request is for either:
- a relative flag added to linear_extrude, or
- a new command relative_extrude or similar.

Here is a taper module:

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13128/2015-07-13_13_54_46-taper.png> 
This works by incrementally combining the hull() of a pair of cylinders,
where the diameter expands exponentially..
Instead I propose something like this:

The idea is bit like a macro in a lisp-like language. It would create an
implied let() with 'step' defined as a for variable incrementing from
[0:steps].
This could be used as a factor within each iteration.
At each iteration the new shape(2D) would be created based on the previous
one.
So rotates will be local around the center of the previous face and the face
normal would define the Z axis for the next step.
This way many kinds of shapes can be represented including ones that curve
and twist relative for each step.
E.g. 

Would create a 180 degree arc in X of the polygon tapering by 95% each
iteration.

If using the existing linear extrude, and adding a relative flag, then not
as many shapes can be created. The flag would be interpreted as indicating
that the next step is local to the just-created face.

I suspect there is a way to do this in the current OpenSCAD using
multmatrix, projection, children(), and hull().
But I am proposing making it work differently and perhaps more simply for
OpenSCAD2.

All issues are fixed (not update in repo yet), except the license part.
Please let me know what's the best description. 

Will do more offline tests to make sure before I push it to the repo. 

Also, if this comes to being usable, maybe consider if there's a better way
of using it. No matter how I'll write down clearly development instruction
in case someone wants to modify it.

Do a F5, then select from View "Thrown Together", and look from below,
youll see a magenta face.Thats cure cue. The winding order for the bottom
polygon is wrong:
.change:[0, 1, 2] to [0, 2, 1]

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Rotate_extrude not closing
Message-ID: <1436781010188-13132.post@n5.nabble.com>

I've been working on this handle maker which uses profiles for the handle
shapes.
Its all working rather well but f6 wont generate an object.
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:923244

Can anyone see what I'm doing wrong ?

I thought it was to do with the profiles I'm sending to rotate_extrude not
being closed.
I've tried profiles with the inner perimeter open. as well as closed. 
The included profiles (in the scad) are open.
I get the same error:


<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13132/Customizable_profiled_handles.png> 


Now I think its something to do with how I'm using the if-then-else
construct and returning shapes internally.
Here is a shorter test script that exposes the problem.
There are two "module handle()"s defined. one is commented.
The commented one works and the uncommented one does not. The difference is
to do with the if statement which I have removed from the commented out
version.
Here:

You'll see the problem when you press F6 in OpenSCAD.
What am I missing ? explicit union's maybe ?

To join the fun, I now have a SpaceMouse Wireless :-)

It turns out Linux support via hidapi might not be the best
option as the receiver is detected as Joystick with 7 axis
already (hmm, not sure why 7, the last one seems dead, which
does fit the advertised 6 degrees of freedom). So just using
the joystick interface is probably the out-of-the-box solution.

The joystick driver I've toyed with before using an XBox
controller works quite nicely with the 3d mouse too. I don't
see any issues regarding the rotation.

The hidapi protocol does look different for my device compared
to what I figure from the 3Dtest program.
The button part is similar (3 byte packet, starting with 0x03),
but for the axis movement I'm getting a 13 byte packet with all
axis values.
But of cause it's possible the low-level joystick driver does
interfere here.

I've also added a simple prototype DBus driver using the Qt DBus
interface.

ciao,
   Torsten.

Thank you! That's a great explanation.

I just tried your code out, and it worked perfectly, though I was surprised
to find that it turns out to actually be slower than using hull() when
rendering. This was a complete surprise to me. Creating a single rod with
$fn=72 took 20 seconds to render! This is no fault of your code -- even
rendering a cylinder and two spheres without the multmatrix takes longer to
render than the hull of two spheres. (I guess I really should have tested
that before I asked my original question.)

In any case, I'll definitely remember to consider using multmatrix when
working out the transformation I need as individual rotations turns out to
be too hairy.

Thanks again.

I recalled reading somewhere that multimatrix is a 4x4 matrix and 
is slow in nature, so many game programmers separate the rotation 
part (3x3) and the translation part (3x1) to speed it up. Not sure if it 
that's the case though. 

It will be much faster if you can generate points on both end points 
and use polyhedron. Steps :

Let P,Q are the two points where the rod links.

1) Generate points around P ==> P_pts = [p0,p1,p2.....]
2) Generate points around Q ==> Q_pts= [q0,q1,q2 ...]

they are points of a circle at P,Q, resp:

3) then pts = concat( P_pts, Q_pts) = [ p0,p1.... q0,q1 ...]

4) Use the faces() (see  here
<http://forum.openscad.org/A-faces-function-for-simple-polyhedrons-td12809.html> 
) to generate faces: 

   faces = faces(shape="rod", nside= len(P_pts), nseg=1)

5) Make a polyhedron:

   polyhedron( point= pts, faces=faces )

In cases of 72 sides, this takes about 1~2 sec or less .

Hmm, a couple of the descriptions are a bit off, and I'm hoping to eventually
get Doxygen documentation on the entire library, but first comes tidying up the
messy interfaces.

Like some have noticed, circular_pitch in the gear module uses broken units
(something to do with radians that I don't quite understand, but have worked out
a formula to convert circular pitch from length units to whatever gear()
requires. I've provided a function for this called convertcp(). You use it like
this for a 2D gear with a circular pitch (distance along the pitch circle's
perimeter between teeth) of 5 and 10 teeth:

  gear (number_of_teeth = 10, circular_pitch = convertcp (5), flat = true);

I'd like to change this so that it no longer needs convertcp() which I see as a
kludge, but this requires breaking the MCAD API and, as a result, older designs
using this library.

As such, there is an ongoing effort to unify the naming conventions of all MCAD
modules and functions into mcad_foo_bar_baz() format (we currently have
lowerCamelCase, UpperCamelCase and bare_underscores all in the same tree and
it's quite a clusterfuck), while providing compat shims with the API of the
current master branch so that older designs will work. The doxygen comments will
also be added along the way.

Probably this would be a worthwhile interface to add.

Have you tried spacenavd?
On Debian the libspnav-dev package comes with test and demo code. The
"cube" demo didn't work out of the box as it used the X11 protocol but
"simple_af_unix" did work.

I expect that we will go with spacenavd / libspnav on Linux. It seems
the best option there.

For MacOS it may be better to avoid HIDAPI and use the native MacOS
systemcalls.

The problem with rotation is gimbal lock. The "cube" example in libspnav
shows how to do the rotation and avoid this by using quaternions. I try
to understand this and port it to OpenSCAD. But my math-foo is a bit rusty.

Fits. The first byte is the report ID. What ID did you get? The
remaining 12 bytes are the six axes as int16_t. Can you determine how
this int16_t are mapped to the axes? And what is the USB vendor /
product ID? This information may be sufficient for me to add MacOS
support for this gadget.

Probably. What does "lsusb -v" show? Look for "Report ID" 1, 2, 3.

Yeah, I looked through all of that while dissecting the gear module, and
everywhere I looked, circular pitch is defined as distance between the same spot
of adjacent teeth along the circumference of the pitch circle.

Distance *should* be measured in mm or inches (let's just designate this as
$length_unit for the time being), but for whatever reason, the original gear()
module used circular pitch values measured in units of
"(PI / 180) $length_unit".

In order to preserve backward compatibility with old designs that use this
module, we have to accept values specified in terms of that odd unit.

Huh, what? CSG as I know it is Constructional Solid Geometry, which is a
technique of creating 3D models by combining solids, implemented by libcgal and
libopencsg for openscad. Do you mean something else?

Also, generating G-code is a non-trivial thing. I don't really think
it should be part of a CAD program.

The only one I know of, is IceSL (http://www.loria.fr/~slefebvr/icesl/).

For some discussion about IceSL, see the other thread:
http://forum.openscad.org/color-in-renderer-for-visualization-td12952.html

I think the bigger challenges with G-code generation (for 3d printers)
are things like support structures, bridge handling and similar stuff.
It might be nice to skip STL but on my totally personal wishlist for
slicer improvements, that would be very much at the bottom (just below
support for G2/G3 ;-)

ciao,
  Torsten.

Just updated openscad_offliner:

1) All styles are taken care of. So there is no more attempt of internet
connection;

2) Code has gone thru major refacturing into smaller pieces for easier
maintenance . 

3) license statement now looks like this (do let me know if this is good
'cos I simply copy / modify a statement from the wiki licensing page without
giving much thought):

I'd say the first stage of an offliner is completed. I'll leave it for now

You don't need a function.  Just multiply the circular pitch you want by
57.29578, which is 180/pi.

You can also use the deg(x) function from <MCAD/math.scad>, which performs
a radians to degrees conversion.
It's the same function.

OpenSCAD is different from every other programming language I know, in that
the trig functions take arguments measured in degrees instead of radians.
If you are porting software from another language into OpenSCAD, you should
take this into account. I suspect that gear() was ported from another
language, but without converting radians to degrees in the calls to sin(),
cos() etc.

RepRap Host Software, according to this blog post from 2011
http://blog.reprap.org/2011/10/say-goodbye-to-unsightly-stl-triangle.html. I
assume it still does. 

There's a suggestion there that Marius added Export to CSG to make this
easier. It seems that printing from a CSG model was the "way of the future"
back then, but doesn't seem to have caught on.

It is strange how knowledge like this seems to get lost to the community,
and has to be "rediscovered".

Maybe, but I'd say this software is dead. It's not updated for 3 years
and https://reprappro.com/software/ does not even mention it.

I guess it hasn't because it's only easy at the first glance and the
benefit is quite limited for a big selection of models.

The article also says...

...and looking at the change history, that adding of more things never
happened. So the supported feature set is going to work for probably
3% of my own models.

There would be a number of nice benefits of using some higher level
interface between modeler and slicer (or more advanced file formats).
The most interesting one surely the possibility to retain the ideal
information for longer (e.g. leaving a circle a circle instead of
converting to a polygon early).
Getting this to work is not going to be easy, but it might happen
eventually. We'll see what the future brings :-).

ok fixed it. 
The profile has no central hole. I shift the profile so that the leftmost
edge is the center of the object. However CGAL can't cope with this.
So ow I shift it so there is a 0.1mm dia hole through the center and then I
add a cylinder to overlap this to make it manifold.

So my problem was caused by the rotate_extrude operator and my lack of a
central hole.

Theoretically a raytracer like POVRay - which does evaluate CSG objects
natively - could be used to help create G-Code but its an open problem and
the slicing approach seems to be much more prevalent at this stage. There is
little advantage to traversing the CSG tree directly to generate slice based
g-code. You might as well tessellate to STL and then us the same slicer as
everyone else. (IMHO)

This seems a bit more complete:
http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13121/InvoluteGearsDoc.txt

The parts you got incomplete in
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/MCAD are the parts relating
to pitch, and twist.

Twist is to make helical and herringbone gears (which have advantages entirely
unrelated to resisting delamination, heck they probably delaminate easier than
normal spur gears), but practically nobody specifies helical gears in terms of
the amount of twist (you can't even tell whether they mesh without calculating
the helix angle). In the dev branch, I added helix_angle to replace that and
plan to drop the "twist" option in the new API.

Now try doing that for every time you make a gear. I can never remember whether
it's 180/pi or pi/180, which was why I made the function in the first place.

Doug suggested using deg(x) which is easier to recall, but is pretty much a
lucky coincidence -- deg(x) is a conversion from radians to degrees, but
circular pitch is a measure of length, not angle.

In fact, circular pitch should have nothing to do with angles whatsoever. The
circular pitch of a gear that meshes with a rack is equal to the pitch of the
rack, and the pitch of a rack.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] "Ignoring unknown variable" issue...
Message-ID: <1436951235171-13156.post@n5.nabble.com>

All,

I am running into an weird issue in a small project with include files,
where I want to override variables defined in the includes...

I eventually made a very simple testcase to illustrate what is happening, it
turns out it is linked to the sequence variables are first defined.

Here is my test case:

Testcase 1:
     a = 1;
     b = 2;

     b = a;  // Works, b gets 1
     echo(a,b);

This works as well and prints
ECHO: 1, 1

Testcase 2:
     a = 1;
     b = 2;

     a = b;  // Problem: WARNING: Ignoring unknown variable 'b'. 
               // a gets undef
     echo(a,b)

This will generate a warning and print:
WARNING: Ignoring unknown variable 'b'. 
ECHO: undef, 2

I understand that a variable in OpenSCAD is a compile time thing and does
not change at runtime, but I would have expected that the parser would know
the 'last' value/state of all variables before resolving the dependencies...

Any comment / explanation on the above behavior?

The explanation is OpenScad uses the last value assigned all the way
through the script because a variable only ever has one value. So a=1 gets
replaced by a= b but b isn't defined at that point.

Loong Jin - Thanks for the reply.  Aha... I see the source of confusion.  The document that you cited as being more complete is the one that I submitted and that is under discussion!  The UserManual in MCAD was written by someone else, no idea who.

The points that you made about twist for helical gears sound interesting and valuable.  I hope that you or someone else will expand on them at some point.  From your comment, it sounds like you are improving the code.  Great!  I have put my InvoluteGearsDoc.txt file into the able hands of the members of this forum, in the hope that it will be tweaked and expanded for the benefit of all.  The only parameter that is totally mysterious to me is involute_facets.  I'd love it if someone could document this parameter.  Thanks!

I've subscribed to this thread, and I'll modify my own documentation with any useful updates, and submit a revised version whenever the document reaches a new level of authenticity.

TimM

Yes, I understand that

I see as well what is happening here, but it is a bit in opposition with the
first part where we say  "OpenScad uses the last value assigned all the way
through"

I appreciate compiler and dependencies are complex things, but at the time
we resolve a=b  we should already know b is defined (and has no
dependencies)...

Perhaps it is more correct to say the "variables" (actually named
constants) only have one value throughout their lexical scope and that is
the value assigned last. Yes the compiler could work out the value of b but
the point is it isn't in scope at the first point a is defined, so using it
breaks the scope rules.

It isn't my design, I am just describing what it does.

That is QUITE a different description than the one that is usually

Functional languages require a mental switch ;)

Just as background info, this is what brought me to this issue: I have
separated parts of my little project into several include files, so that I
could work on these parts separately with smaller files.
In each file I typically never have raw numbers in the modules, I only use
'variables' defined at the top of these files, so it is fully parametric.

For a full assembly, I have a 'main' file which includes all the 'part'
files and call the different modules.
When I want to 'customize' the model, I assign new values to the variables
in the 'main' file; that way I don't touch the parts, and it works well due
to the way variables are working in OpenSCAD (Last value overrides).

What putted me in trouble was that I wanted to have a variable from file A
derived from a variable from file B. Sometimes it worked, and sometimes not,
depending on the include order -- which is the issue I described here.

Now I appreciate that a better solution would be to use module parameters
with default values, but I didn't wanted to end up with modules having a
huge list of parameters (maybe I should...)

The way to avoid long parameter lists is to represent properties of an
object with a named list and just pass that. For example I have
M3_cap_screw, etc, and pass that along with its length to module screw(),
which draws it and functions like screw_clearance_radius().

I use the /hash parameter model/ (see my signature) and just 
update the value whenever I want, so I hardly encounter this issue. 

Another benefit of the hash parameter model is that you will be able 
to pack similar or related parameters in one junk so the name space 
won't be packed with tons of vars.

Thanks for the replies. What started me on this path is knowing that most
printer firmware has very good circle routines to implement G02 and G03.
Going the triangle route loses the knowledge that you wanted a circle.

wow that's really clever. But maybe in openSCAD2 we should try to make it
siompler like have dictionaries - e.g. Python dictionaries, or LISP like
association lists.
E.g. stuff = {"name1" : 10, "name2" : 20, "name3" : [12,22]}
and stuff["name1"] returns 10.

The loss of assign has helped to make the code more readable.
and we have mandatory and optional and keyword arguments to modules which is
great.

Oh, involute_facets is simply $fn for the involute gear tooth shape. I think
it's a separate variable from the standard $fs, $fa and $fn set so that you can
treat gear teeth faceting differently from the bore and material-saving circles.

Thank you!  That makes perfect sense, as it allows one to reduce friction where it matters without introducing a huge number of polygons where they are not so important.  I've added that to my documentation.

Ah, right, I forgot to expand on this earlier. Helical and herring bone gears
are at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear#Helical and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herringbone_gear respectively.

Helical and herringbone gears are nice because you get a gear that's at a
different phase at different heights, so your gear teeth don't engage all at
once giving you that clack-clack-clack sound, but gradually, resulting in very
quiet operation (which is why so many people use herringbone Gregstruder gears).

The reason I say that they're more likely to delaminate is that they have less
surface area in common between one layer and the next (the teeth are slightly
out of phase resulting in a slight overhang). Additionally, the angle of the
helical gear tends to result in axial thrust parallel to the rotational axis of
the gear, which further pushes the layers apart.

Herringbone gears are basically mirrored helical gears stuck together so that
the axial thrust forces balance themselves out, but this also means that during
operation, 3d printed herringbone gears are always trying to pry the layers
apart. In practice, layer adhesion's usually good enough that it doesn't matter.


And finally, for theoretically perfect gear meshing, you need:
 * same circular pitch
 * same pressure angle
 * opposite helix angles (or you could just flip the gear)

In practice, you can probably get a pretty wide range of circular pitches to
mesh with each other, and the same goes for pressure angle, but it probably
won't obey the Fundamental Law of Gearing:

 The angular velocity ratio between two gears of a gearset must remain constant
 throughout the mesh.

Well, actually I was thinking of completely ignoring $fn and just using
mcad_polyhole() for the bore.

Actually with the latest version of OpenSCAD we have a couple of interesting
features which make possible to emulate associative arrays (or dictionaries)
easily...

A simple example script:

// Associative arrays...

default_values = [
  ["a", 10],
  ["b", 20],
  ["bb", 100]
  ];

parameters = [
  ["bb", 200]
  ];

// Get value from associative array
function ar_get(ar, key) =
  let(idx = search([key],ar)[0])
    ar[idx][1];
  
// Merge 2 arrays (values from ar2 overrides ar1)

It sounds as if you have some excellent ideas for improving that wonderful gear library.  I know that someone else (I can track down his name if you aren't aware) has made a modification to gear() that produces teardrop holes instead of round holes.  Do you have a rough timeline for when you might be posting your new, improved gear code?

Well, actually I was thinking of completely ignoring $fn and just using  
mcad_polyhole() for the bore.

Indeed. We had a discussion about this  here
<http://forum.openscad.org/Digging-into-search-td12421.html>  . it was when
the change made. 

However, it requires array of [key,val]s,  means to type in lots of [ ],
which is I try to avoid. So in my hash parameter model, I use a flat array
like [  "a", 10,  "b", 20,  "bb", 100  ].

In fact, it doesn't need latest version of OpenSCAD to come up with several
user function for array of [key,val]'s to work like an associate array. 

But it's just my personal taste. Your code does solve the problem and would
probably run faster than mine. 

Btw, if your keys are all numerical, you can simply use lookup:

when using Search I had all kinds of problems in that these two will match:
     "grip", "grip-2" when searching for "grip". I.e same for any 
substring that starts the same.

Also lookup does interp if there is no match. I wasn't sure I could 
count on it for lookups if my field wasn't in the list - but I didn't 
extensively test it.

Most firmwares on the printers, just convert the arcs to a set of small
straight line segments. On Marlin for example it just gets converted to a
set of chords of 1mm length.

No timeline, but some of the improvements are already available in the dev
branch of MCAD. helix_angle, herringbone, and convertcp() are already there.

You probably had the 'wrong' syntax...


The documentation wrote

So you need to search for ["grip"], not just "grip"

Current range syntax:

Proposed additional syntax:

Compare the proposed 

   *for ( i=[:a] ) *

to the current usage

   *for ( i=[0:len(a)-1] )*

it is much quicker and easier to write and read.

Sounds like we could do with a foreach statement:

   doSomething();

We already have such a thing:

for (v = array)
    doSomething ();

You can't use this when you actually need the array index though.

Hmm. If I'm reading that hash table approach correctly then isn't it open to
'undefs' in my code if I mistype the hash key? This seems to apply to both
the hash table definition and anywhere I want to lookup hash values in my
code.

The method I use explicitly defines the properties of my 'object', which
means I get the benefits of the compiler telling me if I've tried to access
a non-existent property:

--- code ---
stuff1 = [10, 2, "red"];
stuff2 = [20, 5, "blue"];

function stuff_length(stuff) = stuff[0];
function stuff_width(stuff) = stuff[1];
function stuff_colour(stuff) = stuff[2];

example(stuff1);
module example(myStuff)
{
    echo( stuff_length(myStuff) );
    echo( stuff_width(myStuff) );
    echo( stuff_color(myStuff) );    <--- fails with a warning in the
compiler window as "stuff_color()" is undefined
}
--- /code ---

The drawback is having to maintain the ordered list but I don't see that
being any more onerous than maintaining the keys for every list with the
hash table approach - the order of the parameters in the list doesn't
actually matter (unless you suffer from tidy code OCD like I do!) as we are
abstracting via "property accessors".

Another benefit to using this approach is that you can have derived
properties that are based on calculations of the explicit ones:

function stuff_area(stuff) = stuff_length(stuff) * stuff_width(stuff);

True. I can't resist the temptation to slip into programming good practice
at this point, despite (I know, I know!) the fact that OpenSCAD isn't a
programming language.

I dunno, I first started using OpenSCAD with 2014.04, and it already had that
feature.

Well, there are still some good practices to follow, such as not hardcoding
precalculated values everywhere.

I think both methods have also different use cases...

The 'property array' is nice when you have a whole set of objects with
different attributes (like all screw types, bearings, ...)

The hashes are more convenient when you have a base object with (a lot of)
default properties and you want to instantiate it with just a couple of
changes: you don't have to define the complete array, just the amended
key/value.

Message-ID: <1437041563643-13191.post@n5.nabble.com>

In that scenario I'd use a 'constructor' for my object with default
parameters

function new_stuff(length = 10, width = 2, colour = "yellow")
    = [length, width, colour];

myNewPartialObject = new_stuff(width = 15);

I can see how this can start becoming difficult to maintain though if those
definitions change regularly. I do remember reading the hashtable approach
and thinking that it would be useful for certain cases - I just haven't hit
a scenario yet where I have felt the need to refactor.

I was wondering. I do that occasionally :-)

if a use("v2") statement was at the top of the file. Could a lot of the
extra functions be the same name as the old ones, but with the different
args needed? Or is that too much work?

This is all great info. Thanks for it.
I'd like to ask an open question though (because OpenSCAD2 is being
designed).

What do you think woudl be the 'best' way to make this work in OpenSCAD2 ?
Should we add a new accessing method, or type or way of doing this so we
don't need to create special code to do it ?

What aspects of the work arounds are the valuable ones ?

Message-ID: <1437048037628-13194.post@n5.nabble.com>

we can get both:


Going back to @runsun proposal:
Current range syntax:

        [ i: j ]
        [ i: j: k ]

Proposed additional syntax:

        a) [ :j ] ---- i can be skipped if i==0

        b) [ i: array ]  ---- j can be an array or string . For example:
           
            arr = ["a","b","c","d"];
            [ for ( i=[ :arr ] ) i ]; ==> [0,1,2,3]
            [ for ( i=[ :2:arr ] ) i ]; ==> [0,2]    

        c)  ^ array  (or some other syntax like [arr;] [ %arr ] etc ... )
            to give both index and item:

            [ for ( i,x = ^arr ) str( i,"=",x) ] ==> [ "0=a", "1=b", "2=c" ]
    ... [show rest of quote]

Proposed to return just the array indices. Not the values.
   
current:
   

Proposed to return two values index and value. (i=index, x=value).
    
current (where the value is a new variable in this scope and not  reused).
    

I note that in Python there is a special function "enumerate" that returns a
tuple of (index, value). Of course this works in Python because tuples are
consts of arrays and can be accessed in a loop like this:

which visually indicates that the enumerate will return two values and how
they will be mapped to i and x.
Personally I find Python's slicing, range, tuple, array, dictionary design
to be very clean, clear and well designed. 

For OpenSCAD I liekd someone's proposal to use "in" to explicitly indicate
that the argument was an array.
E.g.

Maybe this variant coudl be used to differntiate between indices or values
from the array ?

as we need overlap sometimes to get good unions in CGAL.
how about using floats and interpreting them specially.

E.g. align=[1,1,1] does what is suggested
but align[1.1, 1.1, 1.1] would use the floating point section of teh number
to overlap at the align boundary.

The question is would [1,0,0] effectively be doing a 
   - translate([1,0,0]) scale([1.1, 1,1])  
and therefore making the object slightly wider. So the far width was at the
exact position and the scale allowed overlap at the align boundary ?

Part of my idea is indeed inspired by Python. Another slicing feature of
python that I like is the reversed indexing:



IMHO It's one of the features that earn Python the reputation of "elegant".
It'd certainly be nice if we can adopt this, too.

Wouldn't it be a little confusing, 'cos the index doesn't actually "in" the
arr ?

My current version of the hash looks like this:



It covers the cases of undef: 



which can be made to give up a warning:


I have a code to do the string substitution:



So it is possible to make it behave exactly like the compiler warning you
talk about (even more, actually). 

The hash would become (note: untested):

Note: Using the < r a w> Some text</ r a w> tags, Nabble does not pass that
text to the mailing list. You can only see it in the online forum. I just
indent code now. It works if you tick the "Message is in HTML Format" box.

I mentioned this to the free Nabble support area, but they are not as
responsive as the community here...

I have written an OpenSCAD Instructable.  I teach a class at Tampa
Hackerspace called "OpenSCAD Introduction".  I have a different take on the
OpenSCAD syntax.  I have found that my approach is very useful in getting
people to "grok" OpenSCAD.

Heck, it even helps me "grok" OpenSCAD.  With this model in my head I know
what is going to happen in my code.  Particularly with the variables and
control blocks.

I thought I would share it with the OpenSCAD community and see what you
think.

That's quite a good intro.

I'd suggest it is focused on people who have some coding background as you
are using concepts that the average Joe would not be familiar. You may want
to have a disclaimer at the start saying it is intended for people with some
experience. ??

You may want to include vectors in the very early section, you use them
without explaining them until mid way. Explain that the [x,y,x] is just one
case of a vector.

Also some mention that 2D and 3D and two different contexts and shouldn't be
mixed. 

The concept of a tree structure is a good way to explain the if/else and for
loops, showing that they are not loops, but an unwinding into a tree
structure, each node defines the scope and hence is why they can each have
different values of i, for example. 

Maybe use trees to indicate why a=a+1; doesn't make sense in OpenSCAD,
hammering that out of procedural programmers is a key to grokking it.

Thanks for sharing the shell() module, that will be handy, I hadn't thought
of doing hollows that way. The text() shim is also a nice idea.

I don't mind that, where you still use 0:, so where 'a' is a string or
vector, its len()-1 is used.

   for (i=[0:vector]) ...

@MichaelAtOz,
Thanks for the input.  The shell surrounds a shape with a shell that is
thickness greater.  The outside dimensions increase by thickness.

The attached file hollows out a shape leaving a wall of thickness.  The
outside dimensions remain the same.

hollow.scad <http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13205/hollow.scad>  

BTW, a sphere in the minkowski gives a truer offset but can be v e r y   s l
o w.

As a matter of styling, all of the text of the instrutable's examples is
only shown as screen shots, it makes it hard to read and impossible to cut
and paste into openscad to play with the example.

It would be better to show the text as quoted text in the html.

Tim,
There should be links to the code itself.  One can download it and follow
along in OpenSCAD itself.

Is there a link I have missed? I have links to

Transformations.scad
CSG_Tree.scad
Hull.scad
Minkowski.scad
shell.scad
minkowski_text.scad
scope.scad

I don't think a show a picture of code that is not in one of those files.

I want the reader to understand the power of the "!" modifier.  It is not
only useful for understanding how solids move through the tree. It is very
useful for understanding other people's code.  I feel compelled here to give
a shout out to one of my heroes, Nophead.  I have analyzed a lot of his code
using the "!" modifier.

Steve

Runsun said:
Compare the proposed

   *for ( i=[:a] ) *

to the current usage

   *for ( i=[0:len(a)-1] )*

it is much quicker and easier to write and read.

I don't mind if an operation for returning the indices of an array is added
to OpenSCAD.
However, the syntax [:a] is pretty inscrutable, and I'm bit disturbed that
the array a is used in an integer context and interpreted as meaning
'len(a)-1'. That's weird.

How about an ordinary function instead?
In Perl, this is 'keys(a)'.
I can't remember seeing this operation in other languages.
However, 'indices(a)' or 'indexes(a)' would also make sense.

   for( i = indices(a) ) ...

Runsun also said:
>         [ for ( i,x = ^arr ) str( i,"=",x) ] ==> [ "0=a", "1=b", "2=c" ]

I'm not seeing the value of this. I think it's clearer to write
    [ for ( i = arr ) str( i,"=",arr[i]) ]

In the case where 'arr' is a really long expression, you can do this:
    [ let(a=arr) for(i=a) str(i,"=",a[i]) ]

In fact, since we don't have this [:arr] yet, a function is exactly what
I do in my own lib. Here is the test output of my *range(...)* function:

Doug,
Thanks!  Did you get the hollow.scad I posted for Michael above?  If you do
a minkowski on the shell, it adds to the inner surface.  If you then do an
intersection with the original shape you get a hollow object the same size
as the original.  As Michael pointed out it doesn't preview very well.  The
two minkowskis seem to get the preview confused.

I installed httrack, and did the following command:
It seems to work ok.

httrack

-r1

then I opened this up as a file in the browser.

OpenSCAD2 currently uses the following syntax for this:

   stuff = { name1 = 10; name2 = 20; name3 = [12,22]; };

and stuff.name1 returns 10.

This is my favorite !!! 

Except that the last ";" could be omitted:  

  { name1=10, name2=20, name3=[12,22] }

i.e., instead of having a statement terminator ";", using "," as a separator
like the following cases:

   1) for (x=arr1, y = arr2 ) 
   2) let ( name1=10, name2=20 ...)
   3) [2,3,4]

After all, its purpose is to separate items. 

Also, using ":" is much easier to type than using "=", but this is probably
just me.

I think other people in this thread have explained the behaviour, this is
more of a comment.

This behaviour has been discussed on the forum before, and it
surprises/confuses everyone who encounters it for the first time. I
consider it a bug in the language design, and it will be fixed in
OpenSCAD2. There is no reason that a simple language for geometric
modelling should require such a hard to explain, weird and counterintuitive
design for "variables", which are really just model parameters.

The wiki contains language about "variables being evaluated at compile
time", but I think this is a confabulation. I can't find any such compile
time/run time distinction in the actual implementation, and in any case I
have had to come up with a different mental model to correctly understand
how OpenSCAD works. What Nop Head said is accurate.

A more general critique of OpenSCAD, in its current incarnation, is that it
is intended to be a stateless, purely declarative language. But the syntax
is C-like, parameter definitions like "radius = diameter/2;" look like C
assignment statements, and the documentation plays into this confusion by
calling them variables and assignment statements. You can even "assign" the
same variable twice in the same scope, and it almost seems to work, but
then you get weird results that don't fit the model of an imperative
programming language. It's a recipe for confusion.

I would like to evolve the language away from this situation, so that the
documentation and the syntax don't send mixed messages about whether
OpenSCAD is a declarative language, or an imperative language. One of the
goals of OpenSCAD2 is to achieve this without breaking existing scripts
(backward compatibility).

At the documentation level, I would like to describe "width = 10;" as a
definition of 'width', not as an assignment statement. Likewise, 'function
f(x)=x+1;' is a definition of 'f': slightly different syntax, but still
just a definition. And 'module box(x,y,z) cube([x,y,z]);' is a definition
of 'box'. I want the definitions of 'width', 'f' and 'box' to have the same
status, and obey the same rules. This is important in light of another
goal, which is to elevate functions and modules to the status of first
class values, so you can pass them as parameters, return them as results,
store them in lists, and so on.

At the language level, I think that duplicate definitions should be
reported as an error. That is, if you define the same numeric parameter (or
the same function) twice with the same name in the same scope, within the
same source file, you should get an error. So Amadee's original test cases
would produce an error message:

     a = 1;
     b = 2;
     b = a;  // Error: duplicate definition of 'b'

This means that the include statement needs to be implemented differently.
The only reason we support code like the above script at all, is really a
side effect of the semantics of 'include'. When you include another script,

    include <myscript.scad>

the semantics are that the definitions in 'myscript.scad' override earlier
definitions in the parent script, and later definitions in the parent
script override definitions imported from 'myscript'. We can implement
these override semantics directly.

Untangling these issues, and coming up with simple, consistent and
unsurprising rules for definitions and include statements, is part of what
I'm trying to accomplish in the OpenSCAD2 language definition.

Is there any point of not starting that way with wiki now?

I have been tempted to remove 'variable' from the wiki, but didn't want to
step on toes.

Don't forget the cmd line -D var=val issue. It apparently is the main reason
re 'reassigns' according to MK.

For include<> something like the following is something I'd like.

    include <myscript.scad> as ms
    ms.mysize=10; // make it bigger

Allowance for public/private definitions in the include'ed scad would be a
bonus.

The syntax is what it is, because of the way that OpenSCAD2 is a backward
compatible extension of OpenSCAD.

This is an OpenSCAD script:
    size=10;
    cube(size);

You can type this script into an OpenSCAD source code window, and you will
see a cube.

You can put a script inside of brace brackets. The result is a geometric
object that you can pass as an argument to a module:

    rotate(45) {
       size=10;
       cube(size);
   }

In OpenSCAD2, the syntax {...} is an expression that returns a geometric
object.
For example, { size=10; cube(size); } is an expression.

You can give this expression a name:

   mycube = {
      size=10;
      cube(size);
   };

Now 'mycube' is the name of a geometric object.

   echo(mycube.size); // ECHO: 10

   rotate(45) mycube;

I agree with you. I first had these thoughts over a year ago. At that time,
I did not want to change the wiki, because I had no idea of how variables
actually worked. Anything I could have written back then would have been
misleading and incorrect. It has taken me a long time, much reading of
forum posts, and a lot of experimentation, to get to the point where I
actually understand what is going on.

in python you can access a dictionaries items, values, and keys like so:
arr = {1: 11, 2:22, 3:33}
arr.items()   returns   [(1, 11), (2, 22), (3, 33)]
arr.values() returns    [11, 22, 33]
arr.keys()    returns   [1, 2, 3]

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Proposal - 2d shapes
Message-ID: <1437194283288-13224.post@n5.nabble.com>

In the current openSCAD there are limitations on certain 2D shapes that might
be considered to be similar.

Specifically these in-built primitives return 2D shapes:
circle(), square(), polygon()
and projection(cut) allows you to create a 2D shape.

However they are not all equal.
IMHO it woudl be nice if (IWBNI) these 2D shapes could all be equal for the
purposes of further manipulation.

E.g. In my  handle maker <http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:923244>   I have
lists of coords for the profiles (extracted from Inkscape).
The user selects a profile and a polygon(profile) is created.
This can then be rotate_extruded to form the basic shape. Which is working
just fine.

However I can't easily choose between a series of coords or a circle(), or
the result of a projection() onto a plane. Nor can I stack
rotates,translates neatly for those shapes that need further rotation into a
specific plane for the rotate_extrude() operation.

To take this one step further. I can't do a loft, which would take a number
of cross-sectional profiles arranged in (say) X and skin between them using
a profile defined in (say) Y.
(There is work done to create this with dedicated code (e.g.  solids
<http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8907>  ,  followpath
<http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:64679>  ) but its a basic (IMHO) operation
for a 3D surface program and so I think it should be more of a first class
object in the system.)

Also I cannot easily take an object and apply a taper(say) transform over it
from one end to the other. Taper being an expample of a generally useful exp
scale operation. But the point is to apply any shape changing transform onto
an existing shape.

If 2D shapes could somehow be kept as lists or entities of some kind until
needed to be turned in 3D objects then I think several more kinds of objects
would be easier to make in OpenSCAD(2)...

Likewise if there was a way to modify the shape of an object over one, or
more, of its dimensions using another shape(or calculation) then that would
also seem to be useful.

Re scope rules for v2.

I have used this layout


{ // rECESS - the hollow holder where accessories are inserted
rTolerance=0.0; // adjust - originally the ID of the print was marginally
tight 2.05 2.75
rOD=40;
rID=35.5;
rThick=2-rTolerance;
rDeep=38;		// was 45
}

{ // rECESS Ridge - the raised ridges running down inside the holder
rRidgeHigh=0.75-rTolerance;
rRidgeWide=3;
rRidgeWide0=6.2;	// at mid-line parallel with slot at top
rRidgeNum=6;	// spacing, includes the one cut away by wide slot
}

To group the definitions but mainly to allow me to collapse them in the
editor.

I think I have seen other code in the wild doing so too.

Is that going to be problematic in v2 scoping?

assign() is deeply unfortunate - something like

would have worked better. 

I do disagree on the C assign statements however. 

	x = 4

is mathematics. It's BCPL (and thus C) that abused it. Some languages at
least had the taste to use :=   ;)

In other words I don't think the use of a = b; is a mistake in OpenSCAD,

I agree entirely with your description of the problem and proposal. Once
you've got clean groups I think the problem (for me at least) with
include goes away, as I can cleanly define a set of parameters as a
function or object and pass them to the method that generates my thing.

I agree.  Coming from Modula 2 and Pascal, ":=" for assignment and "=" for equality seems clear and correct.  The C (and now countless other languages) convention of "=" meaning assignment and "==" meaning equality test is popular, but wrong-headed.

I know I will not win this argument.  Just saying.

I don't think the issue is the syntax of the assignment statement. It is
the semantics of x = x +1, which is nonsense mathematically and so should
not appear in a description of geometry, which is what OpenScad is.

I see. It's not just a place holder for data. This is cool.

I'll bring my idea about this to your other thread about "OpenSCAD2 doc"
(more relevant to the thread topic)

1) I'd prefer that this geometric object has some *built-in parameters*, for
example, like *points*:

   echo( mycube.points );

   So we can do these:

      1.1) translate( mycube.points[3]) yourcube;

      1.2) for( p= mycube.points ) translate( p ) sphere(...);

      1.3)  for( i= mycube.points[4:] )         // pick up the second half 
                 mycube.points[i]= somefunc(i); // re-assign points to
change shape

      1.4) Assuming we have a Line() module, draw a line to connect two
objects (at specified points):

            Line( mycube.points[0], yourcube.points[2] )

      1.5) distance( mycube.points[0], yourcube.points[2] )

2) I'd prefer all those actions, like translate, rotate, union, etc, can be*
functions*, too:

       yourcube = rotate( mycube, 45 );
       hiscube = translate( yourcube.points[2] );

All the ideas have one thing in mind: *keeping track of coordinates for
further operations. *

Before OpenSCAD evolves to a stage that can handle all you mentioned, your
best bet is probably using polyhedron. In fact, I believe you are in the
same stage that I encountered before. It's time when I started focusing on
polyhedron.

MichaelAtOz notes that a top level compound statement, {...}, is
interpreted by OpenSCAD as if the braces aren't there. Michael uses this to
group sets of related definitions within a large script, so that they can
be collapsed by the folding tree editor.

This is new information for me: I didn't know that people are using this
design pattern "in the wild", as Michael says.

Right now, the idiomatic way to write this code in OpenSCAD2 is:

include { // rECESS - the hollow holder where accessories are inserted
rTolerance=0.0; // adjust - originally the ID of the print was marginally
tight 2.05 2.75
rOD=40;
rID=35.5;
rThick=2-rTolerance;
rDeep=38;               // was 45
};

include { // rECESS Ridge - the raised ridges running down inside the holder
rRidgeHigh=0.75-rTolerance;
rRidgeWide=3;
rRidgeWide0=6.2;        // at mid-line parallel with slot at top
rRidgeNum=6;    // spacing, includes the one cut away by wide slot
};


Explanation: the OpenSCAD2 'include' operator takes an object expression as
an argument, and {...} is an object literal.

Also, in OpenSCAD2, objects are the replacement for groups in the CSG tree.
Each non-leaf node in the CSG tree is an object. As a result, "top level
compound statements" could appear naturally in code as a representation of
nested objects in a CSG tree. And that conflicts with the current use of
that syntax that Michael reports.

At present, this is an incompatibility between the existing language and
OpenSCAD2 that I wasn't aware of.

The new OpenSCAD implementation will use heuristics to detect OpenSCAD1
code and run in backward compatibility mode. It should be capable of
detecting Michael's code and evaluating it correctly without breaking.
There will also be an upgrade tool that converts existing code to use the
new syntax, and we could convert top level {...} statements to 'include
{...};' as part of the upgrade.

Michael, do you think this is an acceptable solution to the problem that
you uncovered?

Doug.

Hi Runsun.

For point (1), I agree: I'd like to have a richer set of operations
available for geometric objects. Every geometric object is equivalent to a
set of disjoint polyhedra, represented as meshes, and it would be very cool
if you could programmatically access the mesh. Marius wants this too.
However, he wants to be cautious, because in the current implementation,
this would mean that CGAL operations are intermixed with general
evaluation, which would slow down preview so that F5 is no faster than F6.
So I think Marius wants to defer these kinds of changes until we replace
the geometry engine and maybe the preview engine with faster code that can
support this.

I have not done any significant design work on what these new geometric
operations will look like, although I've played around with ideas. I
imagine that the design will be affected by whatever new technology we
choose to replace CGAL.

For point (2), OpenSCAD2 already works this way. Underneath the
peculiarities of module call syntax, modules are really just functions that
return geometric objects, and module calls are expressions. So you can write
   yourcube = rotate(45) mycube;

Hi everyone,

I finally managed to get the rotation right. :-)

Basically, I convert the euler/gimbal values to a rotation matrix, apply 
the requested rotation and convert the matrix back to euler values. 
Works like a charm and you don't have to worry about gimbal lock.

Also, I got multiple MainWindows to play nicely together. The currently 
active window is the only one that interacts with the driver, and the 
driver is opened/closed only by the first/last window.

Regards
Gert

PS: I tend to prefer the direct spnav connection over using X11 events, 
because I hope Wayland will take over the world soon. (Which, in X11 
terms, probably means in the next one or two decades, I guess...)

Cool.

I've just finished integrating the patch that Jochen posted,
it's now in:

https://github.com/openscad/openscad/tree/inputdriver2

First commit is basically the patch from the mailing list.

I've set Jochen as author as git does only support one, but
added you both in the about screen. If you want some link
added, let me know or just post a patch.
I've also added the default OpenSCAD licence to the drivers
and added the info about the initial Public Domain implementation
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/blob/inputdriver2/src/input/HidApiInputDriver.cc#L28
Let me know if that's ok for you both.

What I did in addition is:

- Separate into different driver objects
- Move to QThread as c++11 is not yet possible as default
- Collect some more USB IDs (totally untested)
- Add Joystick driver (works with my SpaceMouse Wireless
   without spacenavd installed/running)
- Add DBus Remote Driver based on QtDBus
- Make all drivers compile time optional

Both Joystick and DBus driver are quite rough still and
Linux only.

ciao,
   Torsten.

Have a look at:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation
Also look at the examples from libspnav in libspnav-0.2.3/examples/cube
which is an example implementation of rotation using quaternions.

I tried your code and it is much better then the current state of the
affair. But it still has a problem: The rotation originates at the
origin of the view / camera. It should rotate the object around the
origin of the object. This is easy to see when you move the object away
from the view / camera origin. Try the cube example from libspnav, this
does it right. (Not left).

I handle event reception in an extra thread and send custom QEvents to
the window in focus. Also I support libspnav (for Linux) and HIDAPI (for
MacOSX and possibly Windows) at the same time. See attached code.

> PS: I tend to prefer the direct spnav connection over using X11 events,
There is an other reason: To get X11 events the spacenavd needs to
connect to the X11 server. To do so you have to start it from your
~/.xsession to get the needed authorization credentials. At least Debian
starts spacenavd at boot time, so it can't connect to the X11server as
it has no authorization credentials. Thus no X11 events from spacenavd.
The AF_UNIX way still works, as it is independent from X11.

Instead of compatibility mode, can't include{} be implicit, or does that
break something else?

Yes.

Thx for the explanation, Doug. Guess we'll have to wait longer. 

1) That seems to be what happens (i.e., F6 is as quick as F5 <== feel better
reading this way,lol ) using the lib that I wrote (using polyhedron
entirely).

2)  I didn't know the current Openscad can do this: yourcube = rotate(45)
mycube

Learned lots of things reading forum :) :)

Fine by me, but to be fair, I don't see much of my code in there...
So if you're adding me to the about screen, please take my rotation 
code. ;-)

Sorry, no, I meant that the OpenSCAD2 design document adds this as new
syntax.

I have looked into quaternions a little, but the thing is that the 
camera object still wants euler angles. And since the conversion to a 
rotation matrix was already there, it seemed natural to use that.

Well, personally, I find it more intuitive to rotate around the origin 
of the view.
Take for example an scad file that contains several objects that belong 
together and are placed next to each other. When I want to inspect, say, 
the leftmost object, I place it in the center of the screen and zoom in. 
Then, rotating around a point that is currently off-screen would be 
irritating to me.

You can use "spnavd_ctl x11 start" to tell the daemon to connect to the 
X server once it's started. That works, but it's still a bit of a pain.
I'm glad we don't need to to it that way.

> Please don't troll. ;-)

It's a personal thing between X11 and me.
I won't mention it again, promise. ;-)

What is the release schedule for OpenSCAD2? It seems to have features that I really need.

Just curious,

Yep, that's next on the list :-). Thanks for getting this to
work.

For now I've added a decoder for the different HIDAPI values my
Space Mouse Wireless produces and fixed the Windows compilation.
While my test setup is a bit unusual (Windows7 VM running on a
remote server + USB redirection of the 3D mouse from my Notebook),
I guess it should work on a normal Windows system too.

Multiple OpenSCAD-Windows of a single instance work fine, I'm
not yet sure how to support multiple OpenSCAD instances.
Probably this would mean to close the HID device when losing
the focus. Right now only the first instance is able to open
the device and the connect polling got lost in the driver
separation changes.

ciao,
   Torsten.

I just ordered one, so can help with some testing shortly.

Yes. As I understand things it is easier to calculate with quaternions
then linear algebra with a matrix. They also avoid gimbal lock. Thats
why they are preferred e.g. in robotics. You need conversions in both
cases and they are equivalent.

Probably this is a matter of personal taste or prior experience. The
demos from 3Dconnexion, libspnav and SGI (IIRC) rotate around the object
origin.

"spnavd_ctl x11 start" didn't work for me due to privilege separation
issues.

I took some "inspirations" from your code to refactor my code. (E.g.
separating translation and rotation in methods of calss QGLView, using
spnav for Linux.)

It's been a while, but I have been slowly working away at this. There is a
quite a lot of stuff to pick through. I've now got to the point of trying do
a union with carve. This seems to work ok for cubes, but not spheres :( I
get an assertion error in the carve lib, not really sure what it means.

There is quite a bit of stuff I have taken a best guess at, probably went
wrong somewhere. Latest effort :

Hi Michael. I just noticed the naming convention in your code. You have a
large number of parameters, and you are using a naming convention to
simulate a hierarchical namespace.

OpenSCAD2 directly supports parameter hierarchies, and that might be the
best coding convention for your model. For example,

r = { // rECESS - the hollow holder where accessories are inserted
  Tolerance=0.0; // adjust - originally the ID of the print was
marginally tight
2.05 2.75
  OD=40;
  ID=35.5;
  Thick=2-r.Tolerance;
  Deep=38;               // was 45
};

rRidge = { // rECESS Ridge - the raised ridges running down inside the
holder
  High=0.75-r.Tolerance;
  Wide=3;
  Wide0=6.2;        // at mid-line parallel with slot at top
  Num=6;    // spacing, includes the one cut away by wide slot
};

This gives you names like r.Tolerance and rRidge.High, plus you can pass r
and rRidge as function arguments.

Yeh, that look good. Also the { & } should collapse in the editor too.

Actually everything ius discussed on that thread...
- https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/114

and sample code for sweep and loft (and skin maybe) are included.
The discussion is from 2012 up to mid 2014.

Great stuff !!

I have very little time to spare for this right now. I hope to have time to
start writing code in August or September.

At the moment, I've got a first draft of parser.y, and I've planned out
some algorithms and data structures, but that's it.

I was hoping to get more feedback from Marius, but he's gone off and
started a new company, so he's busy.

There is no "release schedule", but the general plan is:
* get feedback from the community, update the design based on feedback
* carve up the design into smaller pieces that can be implemented
independently, or in phases
* recruit people to write code for the various pieces
* start coding

I've uploaded snapshots from the inputdriver2 branch to files.openscad.org

   OpenSCAD-2015.07.20-x86-{32,64}_inputdriver2*

Right now, no config at all. I guess we want something similar
to the config UI FreeCAD has:

Thanks, I'll let you know how it goes when I get it.

Also I tried.... failed. Wasn't expecting much, but had to ask. See thread
below:

Hello Michael,

thank you for your interest in our products. We appreciate your dedication
to support the developers to integrate the support for our 3D mouse into
OpenSCAD.

Can you perhaps explain why you think that our license is prohibitive?


Regards,

Uta

description: Hi, 

I'm a user of OpenSCAD, I am not part of the official developer group, but
help out with bug fixes and testing etc.

A forum thread has started looking to support your devices, however comments
say:
"The best way would be to use the API of 3Dconnexion. But the license of the
API is prohibitive for Free- / Open Source Software."

So they are looking to support it via HID.

OpenSCAD is free, as in http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html

So cannot include non free components.

Is there any chance you can release something under an open license to allow
wider implementation into FOSS products? Perhaps a bare bones driver? I
imagine you would sell more hardware.

Hi Uta,

To a degree, this is not an issue as they appear to have got the HID driver
version working (at least on one platform) and are fine tuning it.

However for your edification I?ll list a few points, seeing I already wrote
them?

The definition of Open as applied to OpenSCAD is from
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html (hereafter referred to FREESW to
save my fingers) it would help if you read it as it gives the ?flavour? of
the concept. Specifically it uses the GNU General Public Licence (hereafter
referred to GPL), various formats are available here
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL. To quote FREESW ?Roughly, it
means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study,
change and improve the software.?

OpenSCAD is also in a number of distributions to FOSS operating systems
(Linux and BSD based),  MacOS and available for MS Windows. 

Some of the FOSS distributions are known to be fanatical in their
application of the terms of open licences. One recent example was a
requirement, by Debian IIRC, to remove a small Flatter icon/link (called
?The Button? by Flatter) in the OpenSCAD Help/About screen because the
Flatter Licence for The Button did not meet the FOSS standards. Specifically
at https://flattr.com/terms, Clause 7, para 4, ?All rights, titles and
interests in and to any Button, including but not limited to all
intellectual property rights, are the exclusive property of Flattr. Each
Site Owner acknowledges and agrees that the Buttons are provided by a
non-exclusive licence, and not sold or transferred, as part of the Service
and that he will not use them for any use other than his permitted use of
the Service.? therefore it is viewed as a restriction, not free.

The OpenSCAD development & support community has members who are fully
versed in S/W Licencing and take it very seriously. Many are commercial
software developers.

In terms of your Licence, I (and others on the OpenSCAD forum) read the
licence for the SDK at
http://www.3dconnexion.eu/service/dla-programistow/licence-agreement.html
(hereafter referred to SDKL).

I presume that is the applicable Licence?

Where I quote text from the SDKL I will italicise it. Where I quote from the
FREESW or GPL definitions I will underline it.

Below I show sections of your SDKL and relevant conflicting terms from the
GPL or FREESW.

SDKL Clause 1. ?Subject to ? grants to you a?, revocable license ?distribute
in object code form the 3DCONNEXION SDK.? & ?In addition no license is
granted under any patents that may be or later become infringed by your
modifications or derivative works?

GPL Preamble ?For example, if you distribute copies of such a program,
whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or
can get the source code.? and be able to distribute the source code, ? I
also suspect revokable would be an issue. FREESW ?The freedom to run the
program as you wish means that you are not forbidden or stopped from doing
so.?

GPL clause 11. ?Patents?, I?m not as knowledgeable about patents, but at
face value this clause is in conflict with SDKL Clause 1.

SDKL Clause 2. ?In the format set forth below, you must provide attribution
?"3D input device development tools and related technology are provided
under license from 3Dconnexion. ? 3Dconnexion 1992 - 2013. All rights
reserved." ?. 

All rights reserved is in conflict with the GPL. While FOSS and GPL do allow
(and in some cases proscribe) attribution, it is in accompanying copyright
documents or source code. It does make allowances for a copyright and
warranty disclaimer to be displayed. I suggest the ?must? aspect would be
viewed badly, as too prescriptive. 

SDKL Clause 3. ?Restrictions?. Just not compatible with FOSS.

SDKL Clause 5. ?Confidentiality?. Ditto.

That ends the discussion of licensing. 

If (and as I did not agree to the licences, so I did not download the SDK,
and hence don?t know), the SDK requires the use of the 3DxWare driver to
integrate with other software, the absence of Linux support would rule out a
high proportion of the OpenSCAD user community.

So my original suggestion of the possibility of releasing a bare bones
driver under GPL (or compatible) license. Without your most precious trade
secrets.

I understand companies producing graphics cards and other peripherals have
managed to release GPL compliant drivers in some way. Possibly resulting in
their lawyers having a coronary ;)


Regards,

Michael.

p.s. I have just ordered a SpaceMouse.

p.p.s. There is not much discussion re Licencing, but the HID support is
discussed in the forum at:
http://forum.openscad.org/Working-on-SpacePilot-support-need-help-with-rotation-td13057.html 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Hi Michael,

thank you for sending the information. The licensing stuff seems to be
rather complicated. At least for a Technician like me. ;) 

The direct access of our devices seem to be the only way then to implement
it in OpenSCAD. This works fine as long as you are using a device that was
known by the developers at the time when the development was done. If
3Dconnexion launches a new device the developers have to make sure this
device is recognized by OpenSCAD, too. Additionally problems will occur if
someone is using OpenSCAD together with an application that has implemented
the support for the 3D mouse by using our SDK and therefore is using our
driver. But this might not be the case ? or not your problem then. ;)

Let me know if you have any further question. Thanks.


Regards,

Uta

It's better to copy/paste the code here so ppl who want to help don't have to

Good news, I sorted out previous problems with strange results. Basically I
was passing a bad mesh to carve...

Also some slightly exciting news, on this particular benchmark carve is over
10 times faster rendering than 2015.03, 4 seconds vs 48 seconds.

I think his faces is wrong --- there's no index 0. Arrays should have started

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Qt Minimum Version Should Be 4.8
Message-ID: <1437661241344-13267.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi,

I've just tried building OpenSCAD on an old Fedora 14 installation which has
Qt 4.7.4.

This passes the check-dependencies.sh script, but OpenSCAD won't build as
the function QStringRef::lastIndexOf was added in Qt 4.8
(http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qstringref.html#lastIndexOf), which is used in
src/LibraryInfoDialog.cc:48.

The full error message from GCC is:
src/LibraryInfoDialog.cc: In member function 'void
LibraryInfoDialog::update_library_info(const QString&)':
src/LibraryInfoDialog.cc:48:39: error: 'class QStringRef' has no member
named 'lastIndexOf'

I'll install it on a different PC, just thought you might be interested in
this.

Thanks,
Silas

That's interesting.  The script claims you just need Qt > 4.4.  I finally
managed to get a working copy of Qt 4.5.3 in my never-ending quest to build
Openscad for Solaris but have not gotten around to even trying the Openscad
build since I can't get either CGAL or OpenCSG to compile.  Thanks for
pointing that out.

The script checks against the versions specified in the Prerequisites
section of the README.md (listed on https://github.com/openscad/openscad/
a bit down on the page).

If it's just that single method which causes the issue, it's probably
easy to fix so Qt4.4 would still be usable.

As there is no such thing as an automated regression build against the
oldest "supported" library version, it's hard to prevent this type of
issues.

ciao,
   Torsten.

Digging out this thread as there is some good and some bad news :-)

The github project https://github.com/3MFConsortium/lib3mf looks promising
as it's providing the library with a 2-clause BSD license and it does
support compiling with GCC.

(Interesting note... the code is copyright by Netfabb / Microsoft)

That's the good news.

The bad news is, that the GCC part is missing some essential parts,
mainly the Reader and Writer classes. So currently it's basically just
the data model which would be usable (as far as I can tell after digging
a bit yesterday).

Still, that's a good start and hopefully the missing parts will
appear eventually.

ciao,
   Torsten.

Well, an XML reader/writer is cake to drop in if you wanted to; I suspect
the non-gcc part made liberal use of Windows-only stuff.

Sort-of, yes. It uses the OPC stuff which 3MF is based on, so it gets
most of the XML / ZIP / Packaging infrastructure for free.

They did model the C++ interface after COM but according to the docs
it's only "A COM-like DLL Interface" which would work without the COM
magic.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Plugin API for OpenSCAD?
Message-ID: <1437674598636-13273.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi all,

I am currently working on a research project in fabrication.  I am hoping to
make my work more accessible by including it as a plug-in to one of several
general CAD/design tools.  I am currently considering OpenSCAD, Sketchup,
Meshmixer, and Blender, but I use OpenSCAD already for a lot of my research,
so I would like to use it if possible.

I am hoping in particular for a way I can develop a plug-in to OpenSCAD,
rather than developing directly in the core API.  I would like users to be
able to download my package, and then install it as an add-on.  Is there
infrastructure for doing this or something similar with OpenSCAD?

There is currently no plug-in API. What type of functionality is it about?
Why would a plug-in be better than having the feature integrated?

Hi Torsten,

No online stuff yet - some stuff is submitted but it's not published yet.
A bunch of stuff in the works.  But I have some infrastructure up for using
OpenSCAD and would like to make the most of it for as long as possible.

The functionality is something that is not related to geometric modeling.
I'm looking for a way to, essentially, place specific electronics on
objects being fabricated.  It's not something that you'd want in the core
functionality of OpenSCAD, because that's not something OpenSCAD is
typically used for.  But, if people wanted to use my system, it would be
nice to be able to have it built on top of OpenSCAD.

Ahh, D?j? vu. Did we talk on IRC a while ago?

Right, that's probably not exactly near the main focus of OpenSCAD.
And even if there was an API, that would likely provide some access
to the geometric models created.

How does OpenSCAD fit into the picture? Like you have one OpenSCAD
model describing some kind of case and other models describing
electronics parts which are then placed inside or on-top of that
case?
Or to look from the API perspective... Assuming you could just wish
any API you'd like, what functions would that have?

One possibility might be to use OpenSCAD as back-end just feeding
the sources and retrieve and analyze/measure/combine the output
models.

ciao,
   Torsten.

Hi Andy. I have questions, I'd like to understand how the OpenSCAD
integration is supposed to work.

   - Would you be adding new operations to the OpenSCAD language? New data
   types?
   - What kind of output do you need to generate? Is the result an STL
   file, or something different from the current export formats?
   - Do you need to extend the OpenSCAD GUI?

Since you gave your affiliation, I thought it okay to google you. "These
days I am creating tools to enable users to quickly design, program, and
3-D print their own personal robots using data-driven tools."  OpenSCAD
certainly is used for designing 3D printed robots, and one of the original
use cases was for modelling 3D printers, so your project might be of more
interest to the community than you suggested.

Oops - I keep meaning to disable my signature for exactly that reason >_>

Torsten: Nope, I don't frequent IRC much - that definitely wasn't me.  But
I'm not surprised there are a bunch of people wanting to do that sort of
thing.

We are still fleshing out exactly what we want to do - going to decide on
our scope and platform we'll be developing on in the next week.  But we
should have an OpenSCAD model with a bunch of parts.  And then we plan on
placing an electronic device in a particular location.  Ideally, we'd like
to tag it with some metadata.  Beyond that, I am not 100% positive what
else we need to do yet.

>From an API perspective, for plug-in development, I don't typically think
too much about that - usually I just have to deal with whatever the API
developer came up with :-p.  But I suppose mostly I'd want to be able to
define a special display window (allowing me to override the default output
with a personalized output), the ability to add more custom built-in
functions to the language (maybe like an include statement), and the
ability to add to the export options by overriding some default function.
That's the high-level idea of what I'm thinking.  And maybe have all the
new things added color-coded so users knew that that was plug-in specific.
That's sort of what I was thinking.

So, reviewing Doug's list now that I've typed this out, it seems we're
matched up pretty well on what I was thinking.

I've used OpenSCAD as a backend before for my research and it works very
well for that purpose - and I may go that route again, although that
requires me to create a GUI from scratch, which will likely then be much
more crude than I'd like.  Or I may fork the project and embed my
functionality directly (not ideal because then I won't be able to keep up
with how OpenSCAD evolves), or I may go a different route altogether.

Doug: We use OpenSCAD for robotics a bit, and it's been working quite well,
but I think the specific electronics we have in mind for *this *particular
project are probably outside the scope of something you'd permanently want
in OpenSCAD.

Hi Andy,

What licence is typically applied to your work? Is that part of the reason
for a plug-in?

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Proposed concat() improvement
Message-ID: <1437695336197-13283.post@n5.nabble.com>

The current  concat()
<https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#concat>  
has the feature *when there's only one argument*: concat( x ):

(1) x is an arr: do nothing, just return the arr: 

     concat( [1,2,3] ) => [1,2,3]

(2) x is a str: convert the string to a 1-item array:

    concat( "abc" ) => ["abc"]

I can't figure under what situation this is useful, because that one
argument is 
not something users can assign programmably but have to hard code it. i.e.,
there seems to be no point when typing concat( [1,2,3] ) is the same as just
[1,2,3]. 

In the mean time, I found that I have frequent need of joining the
array-items inside an array:

   [[1,2],[3,4]] => [ 1,2,3,4 ]
   
it'd be nice (and make sense ) if concat can take care of this:

   *Proposed:*

   concat( [[1,2],[3,4]] ) => [ 1,2,3,4 ]  

   ps = [ [x1,y1,z1], [x2,y2,z2] ]
   qs = [ [x3,y3,z3], [x4,y4,z4] ]
   concat( [ps,qs] ) =>    [ [x1,y1,z1], [x2,y2,z2], [x3,y3,z3], [x4,y4,z4]
]

but the current concat  simply throw it back:

   concat( [[1,2],[3,4]] ) => [ [1,2],[3,4] ]
   concat( [ps,qs] ) => [ps,qs] 


Also, concatting multiple string arguments makes no sense to me, either:

  concat("a","b","c","d","e","f")=> ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]

It falls into the same category that typing concat( s1,s2 ...) is the same
as typing [s1,s2 ...] so there seems to be no need for this feature to
exist.

Part 1

Runsun proposes that concat([v1,v2,v3]) is equivalent to concat(v1, v2, v3).

I agree with this change. It is useful for the reasons that Runsun
gives. It permits a program to construct the list of vectors to be
concatenated at run time, where the length of the list is determined
dynamically.

It is also consistent with the behaviour of some other functions with
a variable number of arguments, which have already been modified to
work in the same way: you can pass a vector as a single argument. For
example,
   min(x,y,z) == min([x,y,z])
   max(x,y,z) == max([x,y,z])
   chr(x,y,z) == chr([x,y,z])

(I think str() is the only other variable-number-of-arguments function
that doesn't work this way.)

Part 2

I would like to modify concat() so that it can be used to catenate a
list of strings, producing another string. This is part of the
OpenSCAD2 proposal, and the rationale is given here:
https://github.com/doug-moen/openscad2/blob/master/rfc/Sequences.md

So, for example,

   concat("a", "b", "c') => "abc"
   concat(["a","b","c"]) => "abc"

OpenSCAD may already have some of the capabilities you need:
* There is an include statement. You can define an external library of
functions, implemented as an OpenSCAD script, and include it into
another OpenSCAD program.
* The 'color' module can be used to apply an arbitrary color to a
geometric object; the color is only visible in preview mode, and
doesn't affect the exported model.
* The background modifier '%' allows you to include additional
geometry that is displayed in preview mode, but which is not part of
the final rendered model that is exported to STL. This additional
background geometry can be colored. This might be useful for
visualizing electronic components which are not part of the rendered
model.

You mention "adding to the export options". Currently, people do this
by abusing the "echo" command, which prints diagnostic messages to
either the console window, or to standard error if openscad is invoked
non-interactively from the command line. The trick used is to invoke
OpenSCAD non-interactively on an OpenSCAD script, collect the standard
error output, extract the 'echo' output and transform that into the
file that you wanted to export.

All of this is potentially useful if you are using OpenSCAD strictly
as a back end. As for adding an application specific front-end GUI to
OpenSCAD, I am not sure how that would work. What I can say is that
OpenSCAD is written in C++ and uses the Qt library to construct its
GUI. So you could write your GUI in Qt and hack that into OpenSCAD.
Hypothetically, if we supported a GUI automation API, then your GUI
could run as a separate program, and control the OpenSCAD GUI using
this automation API. There are existing tools for automating a QT GUI
without modifying the program (they are used for automated GUI
testing), and maybe that approach would be useful for your front end.

Lots of projects use OpenSCAD as a back end. It's not something I have
much experience with. It's possible you could use OpenSCAD as a back
end in its current state. It's also possible that we could add
features that would make this easier for you, and which would also be
of general interest to other people using OpenSCAD as a back end.

A plugin for a GPL program should also be licensed as GPL, unless the plugin
is a separate program. The FSF are quite clear on that point -
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#GPLAndPlugins.

Personally I don't think a plug-in via separate programs is a usable method,
but it is possible.

As OpenSCAD is GPL, I would expect an integrated OpenScad plugin to be GPL
as well, so a plug-in API of the most useful sort would not be a way around
GPL.

Message-ID: <1437753460386-13287.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hello,

i want to make a brim for a vessel, which needs to be an ellipsoid, but of
course keep cutouts for fitting on the vessel constant. I do a rotate
extrude of my basic shape and then scale the model. Of course the cutouts
get rescaled to, but i need a constant wall and cutout thickness.

How can i achieve this, i tried a bunch of stuff but nothing worked so far.

Please help!

My code:

$fn = 30;

scale([2.5,1,1]){
	rotate_extrude(convexity = 10){
		translate([100, 0, 0]){
			difference(){
				square([10,10]);
				translate([2.5,0,0]){
					square([5,10]);
				}
			}
		}
	}

hoping it will be but due to various constraints it may not be possible.  I
prefer BSD if and when I release code, but licensing is not the main
constraint here.

doug: thank you for that extremely helpful post.  Being able to do things
with color, export, and includes may be enough.  I'll talk about this with
my collaborators and see if it would be sufficient.  If the GUI is the only
thing holding us back, we might be able to come up with a clever workaround.

bobc: Thank you for the clarification on plug-ins and GPL licensing.

That's the often cited flatten() in disguise then, at least
when v1,v2,v3 are vectors, right?

I guess it's not really a normal use case to call concat() with
a single value. Using that to implement different behavior seems
a bit strange to me even if that behavior would be useful.

Right now the full behavior is defined as

- create an empty output vector
- for all input values
   - if value is a vector add all elements to the output vector
   - else add the value to the output vector

Yes, that leaves some cases which are not hugely useful, but why
is that a problem? The same goes for calling min() with a single
number argument.

Maybe it would be better to add some more flexible support for
working with vectors, like splicing and related features which
were mentioned lately?

Hmm, that produces quite a number of special cases. As soon as there
is one non-string argument, it goes back to the normal behavior?

   concat("a", "b", []);
   concat("a", "b", undef);

ciao,
   Torsten.

The way I see it is:

-- When there are multiple args, loop thru them and do-something;
-- When there's only one arr arg, loop thru its items and do-something;

This is exactly the way max() and min() work, therefore it's consistent.

Being an OpenSCAD user of Small Brain, I appreciate semantics that 
follow the Principle of Least Surprise. When a function does something 
/different/ for seemingly similar inputs, I have a hard time remembering 
what it /should/ do for any of them.

My favorite screwup is watching translate() silently do nothing when I 
forget the square brackets around the vector. That's at least 
understandable, because I build my simple models in small steps, and 
I've grown accustomed to the lack of an error message.

However, as a silly example, if you folks suddenly decide that giving 
translate() a list of scalars should add them all up and translate 
along, oh, the XYZ first-quadrant diagonal by their sum, I'd /never/ 
figure it out after my usual typo.

Please use different names for different operations, so I can read my 
code and figure out what's going on. Ideally, my inevitable blunders 
won't become impossible to debug when you're finished.

Thanks...

Following your idea, I would prefer concat() leaves strings alone. i.e., 

--- concat( ) handles concatenation of arrays
--- join( ) handles concatenation of strings 

    concat( [1,2], [3,4]) => [1,2,3,4]
    concat( [ [1,2], [3,4] ] ) => [1,2,3,4]

    join( ["a","b","c"] )=> "abc"
    join( ["a",[1,2],"c"] ) => "a[1, 2]c"
    join( ["a",undef,"c"] ) => "aundefc"
    join( [ [1,2], [3,4] ] ) => "[1, 2][3, 4]"

Certainly, we don't have join( ), yet. 

Note that if a join takes one array argument: join( arr ), 
it is then possible to upgrade it :

    join( ["a","b","c"], "/" )=> "a/b/c"

This is another benefit of having an array as the single argument: 
we can add new argument in the future if needed.

It's actually not that strange, because min(), max() and chr() already work
that way.
The changes to min() and max() were done in the 2014 release, according to
the wiki.
So Runsun's proposal is equivalent to making concat() consistent with the
way that min(), max() etc already work.

The way to do this is to rotate extrude a very thin slice (e=0.01), scale
it into an ellipse, and than hull  it with a cylinder of diameter equal to
the thickness required.

Perhaps use 2D operations to get a cross section of the vessel shape and then use the offset() function to create the brim. This would work for any arbitrary shape.

Sorry, it is minkowski() not hull():

$fn = 16;
e=0.02;
minkowski(){
scale([2.5,1,1])
        rotate_extrude(convexity = 10)
                translate([100, 0, 0])
                        square([e,10]);
    cylinder(10,1,1);
}

Yes, offset is the way to go: it is much faster!

$fn = 16;
module oval(){
    scale([2.5,1,1])
        circle(10);
}

difference(){
offset(r=2)oval();
oval();
}

What about:

$fn = 100;

module MyEllipse() { scale([2.5,1,1]) circle(100); }

difference() {
	linear_extrude(10) MyEllipse();
	translate([0,0,-1])
		linear_extrude(12) offset(r=-2) MyEllipse();
}
difference() {
	linear_extrude(10) offset(r=-8) MyEllipse();
	translate([0,0,-1])
		linear_extrude(12) offset(r=-10) MyEllipse();
}
That works great and fast.

Note str() does the first bunch of examples above.

Not in the OpenSCAD I am using (version 2015.06.21.nightly):

    join( ["a","b","c"] )=> "abc"
    str( ["a","b","c"] )=> "["a", "b", "c"]"

    join( ["a",[1,2],"c"] ) => "a[1, 2]c"
    str( ["a",[1,2],"c"] ) => "["a", [1, 2], "c"]"

    join( ["a",undef,"c"] ) => "aundefc"
    str( ["a",undef,"c"] ) => "["a", undef, "c"]"

    join( [ [1,2], [3,4] ] ) => "[1, 2][3, 4]"
    str( [ [1,2], [3,4] ] ) => "[[1, 2], [3, 4]]"

Which version are you talking about ?

Those are different cases. My examples have single argument and allow for
dynamic len at runtime. Yours have multiple and have to hard code it.  

This would have been more relevant :

   function join( arr, sp="", _ret="", _i=0)=
   (
    _i<len(arr)? 
        join( arr, sp=sp
            , _ret= str(_ret,_i==0?&quot;&quot;:sp,arr[_i])
            , _i=_i+1 )
    :_ret
   );

   > join( [2,3,4] )= "234"
   > join( [2,3,4], "|" )= "2|3|4"
   > join( [2,[5,1],"a"], "/" )= "2/[5, 1]/a"
   > join( [], "|" )= ""

Hello guys,

great ideas, i will give the different solutions a try this evening. Will
report back when i got some results.

By the way, the Brim structure (intersected) is not only two walls but more
complex in reality. I hope thats still ok for the posted resolutions.

Pat

Message-ID: <bd8fd88eacdbfc5965659c0139cc6bbe@localhost>



Hi Group,



I have realized, that the exising implementation of spheres have higher

vertex densities 

at the polar region due the method how its implemented.



So I have created a fast algorithm to create an almost constant point

density all over its surface.

See some samples:



If this is interesting, I can provide a c sample such that it can be

integrated into openscad.

Right, Blender has both algorithms too and calls it UV-Sphere (the one
we have already) and Ico-Sphere. Looks like someone decided it's useful
to have both in Blender, so maybe that would be an option for OpenSCAD
too.

I guess the interesting question would be how to add this.

icosphere();

sphere(ico = true);

And the effect of $fn would need to be clarified. The example code from
http://blog.andreaskahler.com/2009/06/creating-icosphere-mesh-in-code.html
uses recursion to increase the resolution, so the number of vertices
increases quite fast. How's your code doing that?

ciao,
   Torsten.

Hi Paul,



Did not realize that this type sphere already has a name, however, my

shape is not based on an icosaeder and its not recursive.

Only disadvantage is ,that final number of vertices and triangles

orginally not known, this is why

successive "Realloc" is needed until done.



My Algorithm is very similar to the openscad one, however, the number of

circle points in each layer is calculated

individually. 

The challenge then is to merge adjacent circles with triangles as there is

no relation in points



$fn could be used very easily. My Algorithm accepts a default triangles

size(which is fitted slightly)



The Amount of triangles can be adjusted quite smoothly by setting the

default triangle size.



Guenther

Here are some of my code snippets ...



.. currently working with Cork datastructure , just to mention the correct

source ...

I looked at sphere10.stl, and as you say, it has "almost constant point
density", which is not the same as the maximally constant point density and
maximal symmetry that you get from a geodesic sphere (called an "isosphere"
in Blender). Sphere10.stl is irregular, and not very symmetrical: some of
the facets appear to be equilateral triangles, but some of them are
non-equilateral triangles, and some of them are squares.

I'd rather have the real thing: an OpenSCAD primitive that constructs a
true geodesic sphere.

As a point of terminology, I don't much like "icosphere" because it's
Blender specific. The proper and more well known name for the shape (and
the name used by Wikipedia) is "geodesic sphere".

Hi Doug,



this is why I added two STL files: sphere10.stl, result50.stl



sphere10 represents a sphere with few details(like you create a sphere

with $fn=5)

result50.stl looks much better, the triangle size is much smaller compared

to the sphere radius.



Admittedly the algorithm does not create perfect symmetry but the idea

here was to have  more regular 

point density around the sphere

Message-ID: <1437943376113-13312.post@n5.nabble.com>

My recent pull request builds and passes all tests with the Travis server.
"Yay!" I thought.

I thought I would do a sanity check and run tests on latest openscad/master.

If I run the tests on my own systems, I get 70-72% passing (depending on
which system). Some of the errors appears to be alignment (not centered),
some are rendering (edges appear different), some are CGAL assertion
failures and no output at all.

It appears that Travis CI is using CGAL 3.9, the CGAL package I have on my
Linux Mint systems is 4.2. I don't know if it is possible to get the log
output from Travis?

4.2 is dated April 2013, 3.9 is Sept 2011. The latest Ubuntu has 4.5. 

I'm not sure how it should be decided which is the "best" version, but I
guess the version Travis has is not the version most people are using, and
it appears to make a significant difference.

Sphere10.stl has 32 facets, and it is no where near as good as an
icosahedron at approximating a sphere, even though the icosahedron has only
20 sides. The icosahedron is a platonic solid, so it has perfect symmetry.

What I don't understand is why your solids are better than geodesic spheres
as sphere approximations.

That's strange, for a normal "ctest" run, I'm getting this on master:

99% tests passed, 4 tests failed out of 922

Total Test time (real) = 712.30 sec

The following tests FAILED:
	462 - opencsgtest_issue1215 (Failed)
	764 - throwntogethertest_issue1215 (Failed)
	908 - openscad-camtrans-viewall_camera-tests (Failed)
	910 - openscad-camortho-viewall_camera-tests (Failed)

=> http://files.openscad.org/tests/linux_x86_64_gallium-0.4-on-nve7_caiu_report.html

I'm not sure why the two camera tests fail, the other two seem to be some
z-fighting issue.

Could you upload the test output somewhere?

The run log is at https://travis-ci.org/openscad/openscad/builds/72729137
(link is at the green check mark on the pull request / commit).

Normally the test results should be uploaded to http://files.openscad.org/tests/
but it seems that stopped working some time ago.

I think there were some critical fixes somewhere around the 3.6 version
but otherwise the CGAL version did not seem to make much of a difference.
I'm currently using CGAL 4.6 on my Debian system.

Ok, I see the travis log, but it only has the pass/fail line.

Ah, I just realised I goofed, I ran All which includes known issues. But I
think I still get some failures, it passes 845 tests.

I'll rerun it tomorrow and post the report.

For reference, I've created (and posted to this list before) a utility I 
wrote in OpenSCAD for arbitrary geodesic icosahedral sections, including 
whole spheres and domes. It's available here: 
https://gist.github.com/Yona-Appletree/a03bc32a5c5ca6886e38

It would, of course, be neat to see geodesic spheres included in the 
core code. This could be used as an inspiration.

Note that I only wrote the geodesic slicing code, the rest is based on a 
geodesic library found on thingiverse.

+1 for symmetry. Currently you get different interfaces to a surface when you
rotate a sphere, needing manual adjustment sometimes.

Generally I want to comment on CGAL stability:



When I create an openscad script with medium or big size, Openscad is

quite good

in calculating the final shape. I like its quality.



However, when I import existing stl files into openscad because I want to

alter them

(cutting, adding, etc ), I got a very hard time.

Most of the results: it cannot evaluate  and the result is nothing.

Sometimes it helps, pushing the STL file to netfabb first, then try again,

but overall success rate is no bigger than 50%.



Is this the actual quality of CGAL or is it just a stupid error on my side

?

Hello,

actually that works good for a cylinder object, but it doesnt work for a
complex shape like 

polygon( points=[[0,0],[2,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4],[0,5]] );

The cross section of my brim is a complex profile. How can i do that?

Please help!

The issue with STL is that it's a very simple way of encoding objects.
It duplicates information about points which could lead to floating
point rounding issues both at the save and the load implementation.
There is a huge percentage of STL files around that have really bad
issues.

CGAL is very picky about the geometry as the CSG operations normally
expect 2-manifold objects. One issue is that 2-manifold is a bit
more strict than most practical things require (e.g. 2 cubes sharing
one edge). I'm not sure how other CSG engines behave regarding this
but I suspect it's not much different.

The biggest issue remaining is STL files that have zero-faces. This
refers to triangles that have no area due to all 3 points being on
one line (or even all 3 points are identical).
The problem with those is, that it's impossible to create a face
normal vector to determine the direction the face is pointing to.

As workaround it often helps to fix zero faces using MeshLab.
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/FAQ#Why_is_my_imported_STL_file_only_showing_up_with_F5_but_not_F6.3F

So it's not simply CGAL which is bad and it's certainly not a user
error.

ciao,
  Torsten.

I'd like to provide an alternative way of seeing this. Note that this is 
the way I see it (to make it more easily understood), not an
understanding of how it actually operates behind, which I have no
knowledge about. 

openscad scans thru codes twice. The first scan checks syntax
and eliminates repeated var assignments. So the code:

     a = 1; 
     b = 2; 
     a = b;  

becomes this after the first scan:

     a = b; 
     b = 2; 
     //a = b; <== this line is to be ignored by the 2nd scan. 

The 2nd scad actually runs the code, which gives up a
warning that variable "b" is unknown when it sees a=b
before b is assigned. 

With this in mind, whenever you see :

   WARNING: Ignoring unknown variable X

It could be one of the following two conditions :

1) X is not defined in any place prior to that line,
    means the issue is on X;

2) You try to assign X to something:

    A = X

   but A is already defined prior to that line. 

   In this case, *the issue is on A, not on X.*

So besides checking if X is pre-defined, remember to also 
check if A is pre-defined.

Maybe you could post your vessel for us to have a look at.

The sweep path, as far  as I know, needs you to input the path as a
numerical expression.
This is probably not known for an arbitrary vessel.

Use projection with cut=true (assuming the base of the object is at z=0),
then scale it out and linear_extrude up for the thickness you want. That
should get you close to what you want.

Keep it roughly equal to a single layer thickess (that your slicer would
use) or else you'll have more problems.

Frankly, brims are more easily added by the slicer in most cases (both Cura
and Slic3r will add brim gcode).

I could be misreading "brim". I would subtract the original projection.

Hello,

i cant post the vessel as code since i only have it as prototype model here.
I am fitting the Brim by measuring the vessel manually. However i made a
professional MS Paint drawing  describing the situation roughly so you can
maybe get the idea better.

Thanks for the reply, hope you can help me!

Hello Peter,

no not really, see the  link

for a quick sketch of what i need.

Maybe an admin can actually merge this Thread and the linked one?

Hi, 

thanks for the code, but i dont think it makes a good ellipse. I used hull()
around the for-loop to illustrate that. See the picture.

You might consider a rotate_interpolate of a profile (the green shape) and
then scale the result more in Y than X.
E.g. 
scale([x_scale,y_scale,1])
rotate_extrude($fn=Faceted)
      polygon(profile);

Where profile is a list of xy points. [[x1,y1], [], ...]
You can make the path in inkscape and use "Paths to OpenSCAD"
Extension(plugin).
E.g. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:923244/#instructions

I'm also reminded of this:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:116447

Which I think needs less code to do what its doing but is one way to do it.

Hi,

unfortunately rotate_extrude() followed by scale() will give me an uneven
brim Thickness. It will be wider in the scaled dimension and more narrow in
the shorter side of the ellipse, so it cant fit on the elliptic vessel which
has a constant wall thickness.

Regards,

Patrick

Hello guys,

@wolf: Sorry i overread in your post that only the inner boundary is an
ellipse. You are of course right about that!

I made some advancements in creating an elliptic brim with sweep() in
scad-utils.

However, i dont get why my extruded shape twists around its path with my
ellipse equation:
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13333/twisted_shape.png> 

Here is my code:

use <list-comprehension-demos/sweep.scad>
use <scad-utils/transformations.scad>
use <scad-utils/shapes.scad>

A=450;   //long half-axis of ellipse 
B=300;   //short half-axis of ellipse 

/*
function f(t) = [
    (t / 1.5 + 0.5) * 100 * cos(6 * 360 * t),
    (t / 1.5 + 0.5) * 100 * sin(6 * 360 * t),
    200 * (1 - t)
];
*/
function e(i) = [
    450 * cos(6 * 360 * i),
    300 * sin(6 * 360 * i),
    0
];

function shape() = [
    [-10, -1],
    [-10,  6],
    [ -7,  6],
    [ -7,  1],
    [  7,  1],
    [  7,  6],
    [ 10,  6],
    [ 10, -1]];

function myshape() = square(10);
    
    
step = 0.0005;

/*
path = [for (t=[0:step:1-step]) f(t)];
path_transforms = construct_transform_path(path);
sweep(shape(), path_transforms);
*/

path = [for (i=[0:step:1-step]) e(i)];
path_transforms = construct_transform_path(path);
sweep(myshape(), path_transforms);

Is this a good enough approximation for the cross section of the brim:

?


$fn = 32;
// vessel thickness = 4 (defined by the polygon in vessel())
vt=4;
// brim height
bh=10;

module vessel(){
    polygon(
points=[[0,0],[1,0],[1,3],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4],[3,3],[4,3],[4,0],[4,-1],[0,-1]]
);
}

module brim_2d(){
    translate([0,bh-vt,0])
        difference(){
                circle(vt);
                translate([-vt,0,0])square(2*vt,true);
                translate([0,-vt,0])square(2*vt,true);
        }
    difference(){
        square([vt,bh-vt]);
        vessel();
    }

}

brim_2d();

This may not help your case directly, but here's one way to use 2D Minkowski
to create an extension in a particular direction for an arbitrary 2D shape:

https://github.com/clothbot/ClothBotCreations/blob/master/examples/directional_minkowski.scad

You can then use it as a mask for other shapes, features, etc.

Enable "Animation" for fun; looks kinda like a projected shadow.

Andrew.

You stitched your cube correctly.
The face x=0 is made up of 4 triangles.

Do you have problems with the exported STL?

I don't think it is a valid triangulation because the vertices at 30 meet
the side of the triangles on the top and bottom, not at a vertex.

Here is my first take on the brim problem.
This is done by chain-hull()ing the profile at angle aa and aa+delta aa,
respectively.
One problem of chain-hull()ing is that it can only handle convex profiles,
therefore the profile of the vessel is subtracted by parts.
(The second problem is that it gets slow for higher resolution (here $fn
and fn_a))

But there is still a problem with the angle of the profile along the
ellipse: the profile points in the direction of the angle aa, but it should
point along the normal of the ellipse at angle aa.
This can be seen in the third picture.
Now this will require some work with trigonometry and a pencil. :(
Or does someone know the angle of the normal on an ellipse as function of
the angle of the "radius"?

The code is in the appendix.

The problem starts if you do something with your cubes.
Like subtracting a cylinder.



// CUBE size=60
// Meshed with 2 triangles per face, except face x=0 which has 4 triangles

// If set to false, draws 1 cube, renders OK, imports into MeshLab OK.
// If set to true, draws 2 cubes, on render:
//     "WARNING: Object may not be a valid 2-manifold and may need repair!"
Show_Rendering_Error=true;

p=[[0,0,0],[60,0,0],[60,60,0],[0,60,0],
   [0,0,60],[60,0,60],[60,60,60],[0,60,60],
   [0,30,0],[0,30,60]];

f=[[3,7,9],[9,8,3],[8,9,4],[0,8,4], // face x=0
   [1,0,4],[1,4,5],                 // face y=0
   [1,3,0],[2,3,1],                 // face z=0
   [1,5,2],[2,5,6],                 // face x=60
   [2,7,3],[6,7,2],                 // face y=60
   [5,4,7],[5,7,6]];                // face z=60

difference(){
    union(){
        polyhedron(points=p,faces=f);
        if (Show_Rendering_Error) translate([120,0,0])
polyhedron(points=p,faces=f);
    }
    rotate([0,90,0])translate([0,0,-10])cylinder(200,35,35);
}

I believe it's not possible to render two physically separated polyhedra.
Check out another example  here
<http://forum.openscad.org/A-faces-function-for-simple-polyhedra-td12809.html>  

Using the solid objects seems to be ok, though:

   cube(20,30);
   translate( [50,0,0] ) cube(20,30); 

I have no idea why. 

Is it possible for a 3D printer to print multiple objects at the same time? 

If not, then rendering two objects makes no sense. If yes, why can't render
multiple polyhedra ?

You simply can't have vertices at 30 on one face without them also being a
vertex on the adjacent faces. The cube triangulated that way is not
manifold so as soon as CGAL operates on it it fails.

Here is a version that works. I added the vertices at 30 to the facets they
touch on the top and bottom faces.

Show_Rendering_Error=true;

p=[[0,0,0],[60,0,0],[60,60,0],[0,60,0],
   [0,0,60],[60,0,60],[60,60,60],[0,60,60],
   [0,30,0],[0,30,60]];

f=[[3,7,9],[9,8,3],[8,9,4],[0,8,4], // face x=0
   [1,0,4],[1,4,5],                 // face y=0
   [1,3,8,0],[2,3,1],                 // face z=0
   [1,5,2],[2,5,6],                 // face x=60
   [2,7,3],[6,7,2],                 // face y=60
   [5,4,9,7],[5,7,6]];                // face z=60

polyhedron(points=p,faces=f);
if (Show_Rendering_Error) translate([120,0,0]) polyhedron(points=p,faces=f);

This is to illustrate nophead's point (The point-8 has the same issue, too)

This means that my idea "can't render multiple polyhedra at the same time"
is wrong. 

Gotta go back to check everything I have and re-write my history :( ....
Thx.

At the mean time. this raises another question, though: If it's not valid,
why the rendering is successful w/o error when there's only one poly ?

I guess when there is just one tree node containing a polyset OpenScad
simple renders it. As soon as there is more than one node it uses CGAL to
do at least a top level implicit union and CGAL needs manifold objects.

Ok, I found the normal angle as a function of polar angle.

// angle of the normal (aa_n) along the ellipse as function of the polar
angle (aa)
function aa_n(x1,x2,aa)=atan(x1/x2*tan(aa));

The problem I now have is that atan(tan(aa)) diverges at aa=90 (and 270)
degree.
How do I fix that?


?

I don't have the math background to explain why it happens, but there's
an easy workaround. Just sweep in the X-Z plane by changing e() to

function e(i) = [
     450 * cos(6 * 360 * i),
     0,
     300 * sin(6 * 360 * i)
];

and rotate the result back to X-Y.

ciao,
   Torsten.

No, this does not work:

function aa_n(x1,x2,aa)=atan2(x1,x2*tan(aa));

x1 and x2 are constant, they are the two axis of the ellipse a and b


?

OK, I figured it out. This works:

// angle of the normal (aa_n) along the ellipse as function of the polar
angle (aa)

function
aa_n(x1,x2,aa)=(aa>270)?atan(x1*tan(aa)/x2):(aa>90)?90+90+atan(x1*tan(aa)/x2):atan(x1*tan(aa)/x2);


Now everything looks fine:

And the profile is undistorted along every cut through any normal along the
ellipse:

?
?

The whole point of atan2 is that it covers the full range -180 to 180
because it knows the sign of both the numerator and denominator. atan is
only -90 to 90. I think the reason it didn't work is you seem to have
changed from x1/x2*tan(aa) to x1*tan(aa)/x2 so it should probably be
atan2(x1*tan(aa),x2) in that case.

x1 and x2 are constant here: only tan(aa) changes, so no look with atan2()

Ah I see. Possibly you can split tan(aa) into sin(aa)/cos(aa) and then use
atan2(x1 * sin(aa), x2 * cos(aa))

Yes, this works fine. And its much shorter than my piecewise definition:

function
aa_n(x1,x2,aa)=(aa>270)?atan(x1*tan(aa)/x2):(aa>90)?90+90+atan(x1*tan(aa)/x2):atan(x1*tan(aa)/x2);


Thanks

Hi,
Thanks for all your input Peter, Nophead & Runsun, much appreciated! 
Interesting explanation from Nophead as to why it renders OK with only one
Polyhedron, but not with two.

Here is version 2 of the problem, now no vertices that are mid-facet on the
adjacent face. Same problem as before, renders fine with one polyhedron,
fails with two.

Thanks again for your comments...

// If set to false, draws 1 polyhedron, renders OK, imports to MeshLab OK.
// If set to true, draws 2 identical polyhedra, on render:
//     "WARNING: Object may not be a valid 2-manifold and may need repair!"
Show_Rendering_Error=true;

p=[[0,-10,-5],[2,-10,-5],[8,-10,-5],[8,10,-5],[2,10,-5],[0,10,-5],[2,0,-5],
   [0,-10,5], [2,-10,5], [8,-10,5], [8,10,5], [2,10,5], [0,10,5], [2,0,5]];
   
f=[[8,7,13],[13,12,11],[9,8,10],[8,11,10],
   [6,0,1],[4,5,6],[3,1,2],[3,4,1],
   [7,8,1],[8,9,2],[9,10,3],[10,11,4],[11,12,5],[12,13,6],[13,7,0],
   [1,0,7],[2,1,8],[3,2,9],[4,3,10],[5,4,11],[6,5,12],[0,6,13]];

polyhedron(points=p,faces=f);
if (Show_Rendering_Error) translate([15,0,0]) polyhedron(points=p,faces=f);

Are you sure? I still see some bad triangles. Every edge should be shared
by exactly 2 triangles. It's not enough to have 2 edges shared with 1 edge
of a third triangle.

You need to follow a formal algorithm to triangulate successfully. Have a
look at articles like
http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/graphics-programming-and-theory/polygon-triangulation-r3334

There is an online polygon builder tool, I think we really need a
polyhedron builder tool!

Same problem. Change the second vertex from 2,-1-5 to 3,-10,5 to see a hole
open up. That hole is there topologically when it is at 2 as well. It just
has zero area.

Hi Bob,

Whoops... having re-checked it in MeshLab, yes you are right.

Thanks, I had better tweek my mesh builder.

Wherever you have four or more co-planar points, you can group them into multi-point faces instead of just triangles:

f=[ [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
    ,[13,12,11,10,9,8,7]
    ,[7,8,9,2,1,0]
    ,[10,11,12,5,4,3]
    ,[12,13,6,5]
    ,[13,7,0,6]
    ,[9,10,3,2]
];

?although collapsing the angled face ([12,13,7,0,6,5]) seems to work too:

f=[ [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
    ,[13,12,11,10,9,8,7]
    ,[7,8,9,2,1,0]
    ,[10,11,12,5,4,3]
    ,[12,13,7,0,6,5]
    ,[9,10,3,2]
];

I forget which release started supporting this, but it?s been there for a while now.

Andrew.

Nophead,
Thanks for the clear explanation of the problem - zero area hole, move
vertex & hole opens up - I like that.

Peter,

your work looks great! However, can you explain what you did exactly? Did
you use the sweep function or what do you mean by chain hulling your
elements? I am not that advanced :D

"Ear clipping" algorithm now incorporated into my mesh building code as
suggested by BobC
(http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/graphics-programming-and-theory/polygon-triangulation-r3334).

Now all working correctly.

@Peter

Yes it is a good approximation, but the opposite side points to the outside

Chain-hull is a old but very intuitive way to sweep a cross-section along a
path.
You place the cross-section (linear_extruded by a small height of e.g.
e=0.05, so that it is a 3d-object. As hull() in 3d only takes 3d-objects)
at the start and the next 2nd cross-section a small distance along the
path. Then you do a hull() to connect them. Now place the 2nd and the 3rd
cross-section and hull them together. And so on ...
Now, hull() on a concave cross-section would smooth out the edges, so you
need to build up your piece by chain-hulling parts that are all convex.

Now to see whats going on in my code, just replace all the hull() commands
with union(); you will then see all the cross-section.

I hope this makes things clear.

Using the algorithm I described  here
<http://forum.openscad.org/Two-annoyances-td12935i20.html#a13110>   , this
is what I come up :

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13369/Screenshot_sweep_ring.png> 

The approach can start at any point in the space (so, forget about [0,0,0] )
and 
sweeping through any path onto any direction (so, forget about X-Y-Z). 

The figure shown is sweeping through a circle, not an ellipse. But it will
work 
the same way.

Hi all,

First of all, I'm thrilled with OpenSCAD as I'm a programmer, and this 
fits nicely in with my programming skills mapped to 3D design :)

Though I note that OpenSCAD uses only one core. Are there plans on 
making OpenSCAD multi-core aware ?

Best regards,
/Robert

It's on the wishlist for quite some time now:
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/391

While this would be nice to have, I think the work Bob is doing to
support a different CSG engine is promising even more benefit in
the nearer future:
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/1304#issuecomment-126107128

Of cause both together would be awesome with CPUs likely continuing
to go into the direction of more cores instead of higher single thread
performance.

ciao,
  Torsten.

Great to hear! As a tip, maybe FastFlow 
(http://calvados.di.unipi.it/fastflow) could aid for the multi-core 
stuff ? I might be able to assist with this, as long as I know which
parts are possible to parallelize.

FastFlow sounds pretty cool. Thanks for the link.

The previous multi core thread has lots of details about what needs to be
done to speed up OpenSCAD. I am away from laptop or I'd post a link.

This looks quite interesting, I'll have to do some reading once I
find some more free time.
As first step, it might be not needed to push the parallelizing
very deep into the algorithms (which would currently mean to look
at libCGAL as that's where the CSG calculations happen).
The model description OpenSCAD generates would give some quite
high level opportunities to calculate things in parallel. In
general the tree structure presents a natural way to process
child nodes in parallel.
I guess the challenges are more things like making the cache
thread safe and ensure the libraries work properly. The github
ticket mentions some details about CGAL regarding this.

ciao,
   Torsten.

Message-ID: <1438283739266-13375.post@n5.nabble.com>

The issue covering this is https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/391

I had a look at the work by bgarami at
https://github.com/bgamari/openscad/tree/parallel and it looked feasible,
but he also notes that CGAL is not thread-safe (I haven't checked since he
wrote that) which stalled further progress. 

I think his approach would also work for a different back-end like Carve, I
was going to have a look at implementing it sometime later. According to the
author, Carve is "probably" thread-safe :)

Another enhancement might be to parallelize CSG ops where there are several
children, currently this is done sequentially.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Dovetails
Message-ID: <1568884937.6084151.1438294836548.JavaMail.yahoo@mail.yahoo.com>

Hi, all

I have a bunch of objects I want to make, they will need to have dovetails to attach various modules together to form the whole object (the various swap-in / swap-out modules would be printed at varying times, probably.) I've been thinking on designing the module code, I am not sure at all which dovetail code to use, the critical thing will be that the dovetails are all the same distance from the "top" of the modules (so the top is smooth and level, so to speak, instead of having vertical jumps from module to module.)


I don't really understand some parts of OpenSCAD programming yet; I have coded for ages, since CP/M and mainframe days, mostly embedded stuff, ASM and C / C++ mostly (plus other languages ofc) - So far I can make what I want for the modules, but the dovetail code doesn't make sense yet. Partly because I'm not sure which one to focus in on, that'd help.

They're basically carriers for various things (My life needs organizing, BADLY LOL) and if I upgrade a dial caliper or add in another tool to the set of tools by the 3d printer, i'm trying to only have to swap out the changed tool or add the now needed tool to the set, instead of having to print the whole assemblage over again. Saves filament and just plain makes sense.

Thanks all -

  Mark

Subject: [OpenSCAD] openSCAD not drawing in it's preview window.
Message-ID: <1438304989057-13377.post@n5.nabble.com>

I just installed the latest version of openscad and started using it today
and I like it very much except for one thing.

I'm running it on an old MacBook Pro unibody running Ubuntu 14.04. This old
thing has two graphics processors. When I run openscad normally, on the slow
GPU it's fine, but when I try to run it on the high performance GPU (and it
is MUCH higher performance) using the optirun command it leaves most of it's
preview window alone (I can see other windows and my desktop through the
window, though I can't "touch" them) and it draws in a little 2 inch wide by
1 inch tall (estimated) area near the upper left hand corner of the preview
window. The image is not scaled to fit. I can see the x, y, z pointers so it
looks like the image is translated vertically so that the lower left corner
is within an inch or so of the upper left corner of the window as well as
being clipped at the top of the window and arbitrarily on the right.

I'm typing the "optirun openscad" command in a terminal window and there are
no messages of any sort appearing there after the command.

It does not depend on the file I am working on, it does it with a "new" file
also.

I have not seen any other application do this.

Any ideas what's going on or how to fix this?

I just learned that if I resize the application window until it is as small
as it will go, i.e. the preview window is reduced to that 2" x 1" that's
being drawn in, the content of that little patch is scaled continuously
during the process until finally the entire view seems to be contained in
that tiny window.

I don't know what's happening, but OpenSCAD does not take advantage of GPUs.
So just use the built-in one.

The safe answer is No. For me, when just connecting the device, it
did fail to load a specific driver automatically so it installed
the generic HID driver.

I did not try what happens with the official driver installed.

wiki doesn't work).

So I extract the X11 color names from the  wiki web_colors page
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors>  , put them in a file named
'X11_colors.scad', and found that the line 

     include <X11_colors.scad> 

got me this syntax err :

    ERROR: Parser error in line 3: syntax error 
    ERROR: Compilation failed! 

The include line is the only line in the code.

So I change the names to several variations, and found that
'X11_colors.scad' is the only one getting syntax error: 

    include <X10_colors.scad>
    include <X12_colors.scad>
    include <X11_color.scad>
    include <X11_color_names.scad>
    include <X11_colors.scad>

    WARNING: Can't open include file 'X10_colors.scad'.  
    WARNING: Can't open include file 'X12_colors.scad'.  
    WARNING: Can't open include file 'X11_color.scad'. 
    WARNING: Can't open include file 'X11_color_names.scad'. 
    ERROR: Parser error in line 7: syntax error 
    ERROR: Compilation failed! 

This is kind of weird.

color tests do show that all X11 colors, *except RebeccaPurple*, are
acceptable by OpenSCAD. 

   WARNING: Color name "rebeccapurple" unknown. Please see

Wikipedia > On 21 June 2014, the CSS WG added the color RebeccaPurple to the
Editor's Draft of the CSS4 Colors module, to commemorate Eric Meyer's
daughter Rebecca who died on 7 June 2014, her sixth birthday.

That's what happens when you fiddle with established standards.

It's not clear what you're after, but look at some of the code  here.

I have written an Instructable with some more advanced topics.  I think it
will have more value to members of this forum than my introductory one.

http://www.instructables.com/id/Openscad-Saving-STLs/
<http://www.instructables.com/id/Openscad-Saving-STLs/>  

It shows techniques for recreating a bad STL.  Some of the techniques are
useful for general OpenSCAD design.
