Today I can't reproduce the problem above. Instead it's back to the original
problem.

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n11367/openscad_error.png> 

I redownloaded skin.scad. I believe I have the latest version of scad-utils
because I downloaded it yesterday (clicked download zip on github). Also I
downloaded the latest dev snapshot of x64 openscad for windows. No
difference.

Sorry, forgot to add the cube() call. It works correctly in the latest
openscad snapshot. :) Great work.

Thanks. I'll just give it go on my schools 3D printer and see what happens.
What the worst that can happen. Besides the filament isn't too expensive
anyway.

If you try a bit of code like this at the end of your file to instantiate 2
gears:

rotate($t*360) //First gear rotation
gear(numberOfTeeth,widthOfTeeth,heightOfTeeth,thicknessOfGear,radiusOfHoleForShaft,sidesOfShaft);

translate([48, 0, 0]) //Second gear X offset for first (48 units is a guess)
rotate(360/40-$t*360, [0, 0, 1]) //Second gear rotation + 1/2 tooth offset
gear(numberOfTeeth,widthOfTeeth,heightOfTeeth,thicknessOfGear,radiusOfHoleForShaft,sidesOfShaft);

you can view it in animate mode ($t can be made to represent the frame time,
causing gears to rotate). Looking at the meshing point in the animation, I
suspect your gears may jam at a 48 unit separation.

Sure, if your aim is to learn why non-involute gears aren't good. But if you
want to make usable gears with minimal effort, why not just use MCAD's gear
generator? The involute teeth are all generated nicely already, and all you need
to do is play with the arguments.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Trying to take a cross section of a scanned 3d image and
 failing. :(
Message-ID: <1422876963050-11374.post@n5.nabble.com>

I was sort of able to take a cross section of 1 3D image by using
intersection() but it lost the top and bottom of the image.  Luckily I was
still able to export it and using Sketchup, I was able to bring back one
side so I could extrude it as I wanted to do anyway.

But the 2nd image I'm having more difficulty with because the scanner
screwed up and introduced some bulge artifacts (makerbot scanner) which I
tried to correct by taking two scans in different orientations and then
making an intersection of the two after correcting for the translation and
rotation.  However, taking a slice from that caused some of the vertical
walls to disappear too.

I'm more than willing to post the 3D scans and my code as this is definitely
a bug and should be addressed at some time.  Just let me know where to put
them.

Hi,
Numerical Control - a gcode program that openSCAM or some other nc cam
program would generate.
I would like to use openSCAD to machine the part virtually in the same
manner Vericut does - only with open source code.

Hi,
I have NCL by NCCS to do nc programming. It generates nc code like a lot of
other nc programming systems.
I have a verification package inside NCL but it uses the ncl program to
verify the motion around the model.
I want to use the nc code that is loaded into the machine (after the post
processor) to do the verification. That will eliminate any possible post
processor errors. I would also like to build the machine components,
fixture components and tooling components to allow the verification package
to check for interference between those components.
thanks
Stuart

OpenSCAD isn't a CAM program; it doesn't convert 3D models to tool
paths or generate g-code. It also doesn't read g-code, or any other nc
code variant.

I am not asking to see if it generates a CAM program. My software does that.

I want to be able to use openSCAD to open a CAM program.
Read it line by line.
Use the read lines as input to openSCAD to remove material from a block or
model to simulate the machining process.

If no one has attempted this with openSCAD then I want to explore this
capability.
If someone has done this or is working on this then I want to contribute as
much as I can.

thanks
Stuart

I would start by writing an nc code interpreter which converts each linear movement into an OpenSCAD primitive,
then generate an OpenSCAD file containing the block and all subtracted primitives.
This will likely be extremely slow, but it could be worth a shot.

Is there scripting capability in openSCAD to do this or would it be a
separate program outside?
Perl would be able to do this. There are other string manipulation scripts
also.
Thanks

Stuart,
Do you envision working 2.5D type toolpaths, 3D or 3D with tool axis varying?
Working up some code to generate OpenSCAD commands should be pretty 
straightforward for 2.5D toolpaths. The 3D and tool axis stuff may be pushing 
things a bit. Also, how many tool points do you envision processing at one time?

I need multiaxis verification.
It should not be much more difficult than two or three axis work. The cam
program gives the tool end point and tool axis. With the next point it is
easy to construct matrix to correctly postion the model of the tool for the
boolean removal.

It sounds interesting. Keep in mind that OpenSCAD is not a language as 
such - you create a text file that describes 3D solids and how to 
mergrge them, that the openscad system then 'runs' to create a final lump.
  In that sense it is just like Gcode toolpaths.

Some people have used programming languages to create the OpenSCAD 
operations in a file, which is then used by OpenSCAD to create the final 
output STL solid.

This is probably because OpenSCAD is not able to read another file eg 
the NC toolpaths in Gcode, and interpret into solid descriptions. It 
would be nice if it could.!

You don't. An OpenSCAD program is like a big math equation. x = x + 1 is
illegal because x can't have two values at once.

NCL creates tool paths.
Postworks (NCCS's post processor) uses the CL (Cutter Location) file to
create the CAM program oriented for a specific machine and control.

This is what I want to develop or have developed.

The point of my original question was to determine at what level (if any)
this had been done.

Seems to me nothing has been done in this direction.

If I am understanding this correctly my path should be as follows.

Using a scripting application. Perl is the one I have a little knowledge of.
Open the CAM program
Read in the first line.
Use Perl to manipulate the input to achieve the desired output. (This would
be the 'technical' part). :)
Open OpenSCAD
Run the Perl output line in OpenSCAD
If you are in single block mode or at a program stop (M01) you could
analyse the OpenSCAD model
If you are in auto mode the script would continue without interruption
Save the resulting model and close OpenSCAD
Read the next line in the CAM program.
Use Perl to manipulate the input to achieve the desired output
Open the saved OpenSCAD model
Run the Perl output line in OpenSCAD
repeat until reaching the EOL or program stop (M01/M02/M30)

Having just started looking at OpenSCAD I have a lot to learn about it.
I brought in an STL file. OpenSCAD was extremely fast at this. It was not a
large file but the model appeared on the screen immediately and looked very
nice and clean. I was able to use a cube and remove material like I would
imagine the cutter would on the machine. I created a solid model of the
forging and a solid model of the finished part. It looks as if I would be
able to use OpenSCAD to 'machine' the forging and have the finished part as
a final product.
I would want to then compare the OpenSCAD finished part with the solid
modelled part to determine if the CAM program would indeed machine the part
as desired.
I would also be able to output the OpenSCAD finished part to a CMM and
inspect the model to the print.

Any help at any point of this path will be appreciated.

thanks
Stuart

I really think we should use 'constant' or some equally descriptive term.
(define value? like #define)?

Bite the bullet, this keeps coming up so often...

But we need to clarify the iterative list comprehension/recursion in
expressions, v's the for() loops/if() in geometry... I think we are
having/approaching a clash of terminology of module geometry instantiation
v's expression evaluation.

Let the battle begin....

Instead of doing this, I would simply generate an OpenSCAD script directly from Perl, and _in the end_, open the entire script in OpenSCAD to get the  the final geometry calculated. That way, the perl script will be simpler and decoupled from OpenSCAD itself.
This way you could also experiment with other engines in addition to OpenSCAD by simple changing your output (e.g. Netfabb, Blender, the various openjscad-like tools etc.).

If this were an equation, you'd be right. But it isn't an equation. It is an assignment. If you continue to support a paradigm that runs counter to people's expectation, you will have no piece.

You don't. An OpenSCAD program is like a big math equation. x = x + 1 is

I agree this should be an option.
I like the idea of line by line. That allows finding exactly which line of
code makes which cut. Sometimes, it is clear by just looking but other
times it is not clear which line of code did exactly what. If there is a
way to highlight the cut surfaces/sections and see which line of code cut
it then preprocessing the entire CAM program would be just fine.

Being able to process the entire CAM program will surely be early in the
cycle.

Well exactly.  It sure looks like a programming language to me.  It has
everything you find in a programming language, including comments, semicolon
delimiters, functions, all the tschotschkes you find in a programming
language.  Except variables.  Unless you're running a loop, in which case
you do get variables.

Ehhh???

And we all know that a = a + 1 is because keypunches didn't have a
left-arrow key.  Some languages like APL and SAIL do use the left arrow to
please the mathematicians in the audience.  All I know is that Openscad
should offer real variables.  Apparently I wasn't the only one to get caught
by this.

Depending how you look at it the statements in question are either
equations or just definitions.

In openscad  X = Y + 1 is a definition of X with a scope.

You cannot define X to be two things at once any more than you can define
anything else in life to be two conflicting things at once.

If you see it as an assignment you are going to continue suffering from
iterative programmer disease. Think of it as #define

Back in the old days, I was introduced to Pascal and Modular-2, where 
the assignment was ' := ' to make it clear that it was different.

The thing to remember with OpenSCAD is that it is timeless. The cad 
script you write is to describe an object that simply 'is'. there is no 
'now' object and no 'later' object.

The use of loops is simply to describe a set of similar parts, not to go 
back and do something different with the same parts. Think of the  loop 
structures as a convenient way of shortening the ammount of typing - it 
simply unwinds as a list all at once to produce a logical hierarchy of 
lumps of STL triangles.

As such, the 'variables' are also all the same everywhere, as there is 
no earlier or later as there is no program flow. Perhaps 'Operand' would 
be better than 'variable' or 'constant'.

You may beat this into me, but you will not squash most people's expectation. Hence you will have no peace.

Why is there this stubborness to cripple variables? Is there a technical reason, or is merely adherence to some purist dogma?

I can understand the tree structure of an openscad 'program'. Not only can i understand it, but appreciate it enormously. This paradigm simplifies things and enables caching of geometrical elements. However programers feel the need for variables (in the classical way). If at some point you accept this statement, and endeavor to provide variables in a languge, then embrace it all the way and support variables in a manner free of gotchas or arbitrarily seeming limitation.?

I can see the value of the cut by cut approach.

If you did the whole lot in one batch, then cmpare the result STL to the 
designed STL, eg by differencing, you will get to see gouges and uncut 
areas, but not where in the program it occured.

If you create each program step cut as an additive operation then 
intersect that with the designed STL, you will see over/deep/gouge cuts, 
or nothing, at each step.

You probably don't need to see cuts that don't touch the finished part 
as they will be lots of roughing etc.

There are ways of structuring this in OpenSCAD. You could e.g. describe all tool locations in a list and let OpenSCAD iterate over that list.
You could even have an animation playing through the list to see the actual tool movement.
Some of these things are possible in real-time, while others require a lot of processing.
The best would be to start somewhere and get some experience in terms of what limitations in OpenSCAD you?ll have to live with.

Perhaps this example could help understand highlighting/animation:

Well there you go then, the concept will work (my para 3).
It will not detect an over deep rough cut that misses the finished 
surfaces, and that may be a problem too - loading everything up from the 
cutter to the workpiece.

But that leads me on to think - by modelling each cut step and 
calculating it's volume...hmm, would need to difference the tool with a 
'work so far' model at any instant to check for too much plunge or just 
slamming sideways into the piece.

Could be done.

You would also probably want to do a minowski on the 'designed' STL to 
reduce it a skim. THis would prevent arithmetic errors causing tiddly 
bits of intersection and make the go/nogo result clear.

If OpenSCAD supports user defined attributes on a face-by-face basis, one can 
attach the sequence number (Nxxxx), a g-code file line number or even the text 
of the block itself (perhaps with a level of indirection) to each set of faces 
affected by the respective cut vector.

Marius, Forgive my laziness, it's been a while since I used OpenSCAD, but does 
OpenSCAD support a linear sweep / extrude of a solid body (resulting in a new 
solid that can be subtracted) versus a linear sweep / extrude a 2D profile?

As a long-time programmer, I understand what you are saying. However,
an OpenSCAD file is not a program. It does not execute. I think many of
us agree that "constant" would be a better name than "variable" for
this concept.

Like many have said, the variable concept makes no sense in OpenSCAD,
because the file is not a program executing in time.

Think of it as a description of a physical object. I can't have a
physical sphere with a variable diameter (barring inflatables, and
such). I describe the sphere with a dimension and it does not change.

What OpenSCAD calls variables are really named constants. Since
variables do not exist in the language, there is no "crippling" of them.

The technical reason is that the file does not execute in time. Several
people have pointed this out.

That's how you see the openscad program. I see is as 'add this body, then intersect with this, then add this' and so on. It is a constructive/descriptive incremental approach. If you insist there is no 'time' in openscad, can you start in the middle of your program and wrap around from beginning? Would you get the same object, will it even make sense? The program is an algorirhmic description of a 3d body. An algorithm is a sequence of instructions finite in space, and its execution finite in time.

Because this is a HDL, not a programming language. The closest cousin I
know to openscad in the hdl world is a limited subset of vhdl or verilog.

Identifiers in loops (which aren't really loops, they are a big expansion
macro) are parameters.

For there to be true variables we would need to have real synthesis - a
separate mode that does run procedurally.

Personally I think every mention of "variable" should be purged from the
official docs and the wiki book. Identifiers in "loops" become parameters
as does modules. Everything else is called a constant.

If people bring their incorrect assumptions after that we can point at the
docs.

How you see things is not how it really is. You should be able to permute
the position of any block anywhere in the same scope and it should still
work the same.

Minor caveats for difference() which has special syntax and
functions/modules that probably have to be defined before they are used as
a limitation of the parser.

Technically it allows parallelism and a lot of optimisations because the
functions are all without side effects. Also because it's not a
programming language as such but a mathematical description of an object.

> I can understand the tree structure of an openscad 'program'. Not only can i understand it, but appreciate it enormously. This paradigm simplifies things and enables caching of geometrical elements. However programers feel the need for variables (in the classical way). 

That's why I called it 'iterative programmers disease'.

It's a peculiar worldview problem of programmers, and one that gets them
into a lot of trouble with parallelism, trying to do electronics or
write VHDL.

Programmers can use the python bindings and all the other ways of
interacting with OpenSCAD. Everyone on the other hand (including those
with a normal world view) can use OpenSCAD. Given the number of people
who 'get' openscad and its modelling who are not programmers I'd really
hate to see OpenSCAD lose that property.

The biggest problem I think is that the syntax and documentation of
OpenSCAD make it look like a variable to a programmer. It's very
misleading. Some of the other systems of similar nature do at least make
the difference explicit, or  use constructs that make it more clear what
is going on  (eg with x = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] { blah } )

I'm not immune to it either - several of my tools write OpenSCAD files -
it's an output format for a program in C that computes models of model
railway coaches from a mix of inputs and an inbuilt understanding of how
they are assembled.

In all the years I have been following OpenSCAD new people have been
buffeled about the lack of x=x+1.
But I cant remember ever anybody trying to re-program OpenSCAD to make it
possible.

Surprisingly everything can be done without it.

And if you really,really want to use x=x+1, you can use SolidCode/SolidPython
to generate Openscad programs.

My question falls right into this theme.  A few days ago I set out to write a
little function to compute the average of a vector. Thought everything would
be straightforward.

// average a vector
function avg(vec) { 
	sum = 0;
	for (n=vec) sum = sum + n;
	return sum / len(vec);
}

Surprise! This language doesn't have functions with curly braces, it has
functions with equal signs. Given that it has modules with curly braces,
this took me greatly by surprise. Now, as I read this thread, I see that the
issue goes much deeper than I realized.

So, please suggest to me how to write the avg function. PLEASE don't tell me
that recursion is the best approach; this feels about as pretty as using
pliers to do a screwdriver's job.

Suggestion on the side: I was surprised not to find sum() and avg() on the
list of built-in functions operating on vectors. I recommend adding them.
Surely they are trivial to implement!

Cheers,
Ken

Hi all,

OK, it?s this time of year again. I?ll be short and try to reiterate from earlier discussions:

First of all, the question ?why? we have these ?limitations? will become more clear once we start better exploiting the opportunities, as Alan hinted towards.

I admit:
o We need a ?reduce? function to help collecting information depending on a list of input. Recursion is fine, but people tend to struggle with it and we could offer some help.
o We should probable disallow any attempt of reassignment, to make it more clear what?s going on. The only real reason we partially allow it is to allow cmd-line variable overrides.

To help think about things:
o Imagine every expression in OpenCAD being executed in parallel. Any dependency of existing expressions must be made explicit by hierarchical grouping. This will kill the idea of iterating in order to accumulate information.
o In terms of functions: Imagine a function expression being something you?d type into a spreadsheet cell. Not totally mappable, but it might help framing it.

Now, we _could_ add all kinds of sugar to help people apply their existing programming problem solving skills. Question is more if it really helps us, secondary who will spearhead the design of such language extensions, as we currently don?t really have attachment for these ideas on the dev team.

If you think about the OpenSCAD language as something similar to HTML, but for 3D modeling, you?d still have a need for various programs generating code in this language (similar to the plethora of HTML generators out there). There exist a number of tools for helping with OpenSCAD code generation from existing programming languages (python, ruby, C++, haskell, clojure off the top of my head) and there are tools offering Javascript interfaces for similar purposes (OpenJSCAD, CoffeeSCAD). Until we have a really good reason to do so in OpenSCAD proper, and a really good candidate for which language to support, I think it?s better to keep these things separate.

Cheers,

 -Marius

This was precisely my latest surprise too: no sum vector over array. Can be done with recursion, but yuck! Can't write like so
Sum(v,i=0) = {(i=len(v))? 0: v[i]+sum(v,i+1)}
Because that only works for vector of scalars. If you have vector of vectors you need a new function like above, but replace 0 with [0,0,0], or whatever the equivalent appropiate neutral element for addition. Or you can write it the ugly way:
Sum(v,i=0) = {(i=len(v)-1)? v[i]: v[i]+sum(v,i+1)}

(Syntax may be slightly wrong!)

When you are calling a class of users 'normal', what does that make by extension the rest of the users? Surely you see this avenue is not productive.

If you (and others) insist on no variables, that's fine. Paralelism is a good argument (why then isn't openscad multi-threaded?). But then, as you and others pointed out, the problem is the hijacking of the word 'variable' and use in a context that strips a number of assumptions this word carries with it. Changing documentation and even syntax (maybe) would help eliminate the confussion.

Finally then, absent variables in the language (modelling language if not a programming one - a pedantic distinction at best), can everything be done? Can it easily and elegantly be done? We already see the frustration with lack of sum function. Sum can be added to the language, but it's not the only one. So when are you (and others) going to realize the need for iteration in certain cases (without hindering parallelism even)? And do refrain from calling it a disease, it's no more a disease than purely functional dogma. There are strengths and weaknesses in both approaches, surely they can coexist.

Technically it allows parallelism and a lot of optimisations because the
functions are all without side effects. Also because it's not a
programming language as such but a mathematical description of an object.

> I can understand the tree structure of an openscad 'program'. Not only can i understand it, but appreciate it enormously. This paradigm simplifies things and enables caching of geometrical elements. However programers feel the need for variables (in the classical way). 

That's why I called it 'iterative programmers disease'.

It's a peculiar worldview problem of programmers, and one that gets them
into a lot of trouble with parallelism, trying to do electronics or
write VHDL.

Programmers can use the python bindings and all the other ways of
interacting with OpenSCAD. Everyone on the other hand (including those
with a normal world view) can use OpenSCAD. Given the number of people
who 'get' openscad and its modelling who are not programmers I'd really
hate to see OpenSCAD lose that property.

The biggest problem I think is that the syntax and documentation of
OpenSCAD make it look like a variable to a programmer. It's very
misleading. Some of the other systems of similar nature do at least make
the difference explicit, or  use constructs that make it more clear what
is going on  (eg with x = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] { blah } )

I'm not immune to it either - several of my tools write OpenSCAD files -
it's an output format for a program in C that computes models of model
railway coaches from a mix of inputs and an inbuilt understanding of how
they are assembled.

If you want to add iterativeness, please put it behind syntax so the person
describing the part is explicit when they say "Yes, I want to do iterative
work now", and at least block-level, so the parser isn't stuck assuming
that everything depends on previous stuff. That should make things less
crazy for the rest of the compiler and still allow some measure of
parallelism.

This is how two of the other big HDLs (Verilog and VHDL) do it with their
behavioral modes. It's still a pain, as you can easily have a stack of
dependencies. Alternatively, you can instead use a real programming
language to generate OpenSCAD syntax (SolidPython, scripts, etc), so you
get the comforting and familiar iterativeness.

Yes everything can be done with recursion. I don't know why people say
yuck. It's much more like pure maths and far easier to see that it is
correct.

How can you get clearer or more concise than that?

/"The thing to remember with OpenSCAD is that it is timeless."/

This cannot be true.  Otherwise, "rotate translate object" would be
non-deterministicly identical to "translate rotate object", and they're not. 
Where object ends up depends on which transformation gets executed first. 
And if something gets executed "first", then time is involved.

"Timeless" does not mean "Non-Hierarchical".  R T O is not the same as
T R O because it's R->T not T->R.

There is an order, but it's not iterative nor is there a frozen
"moment in time" one could peek at the state of things and alter the
outcome.

I don't have a problem with OpenSCAD, because I treat it as a functional
language (with some recursion limitations), and everything is fine. There
are ways to implement variable modification in functional languages by
including a data store as an additional function parameter -- I'd have to
dig out my CS notes to find the way I was taught -- but it's frequently the
case that such a design is not necessary.

The 'concat' operator was, in my opinion, the final advance to make the
language essentially turing complete (and therefore fully expressive).
However, for proper use of functional languages, recursion is required in
many cases.

Thinking about the vector sum question, here's a recursive version that
basically uses assignment. The "cumSum" argument stores the current sum, and
the "pos" argument stores the current location in the vector:

function vsum(vec, pos = 0, cumSum = 0) =
  pos >= len(vec) ? cumSum : vsum(vec,	pos+1, cumSum + vec[pos]);

echo(vsum([1,2,3,8]));

I see three complaints.

* OpenSCADs handling of variables is suboptimal. True, although there were
some large improvements recently.

* OpenSCAD is lacking as a functional language. True.

* OpenSCAD lacks a destructive update operator (c-style assignment). This is
inherent to the way Openscad models the target domain (constructive solid
geometry) and it can not possibly change, because it would violate that
union is a commutative operator.
A destructive update operator would have to be valid only in certain very
limited places, causing even more confusion.

Example:

b = 5;

union() { // Union operator
    
    // Operand A
    union() {
        b = b + 5;
        sphere(d=b, $fn=50);
    }
    
    // Operand B
    union() {
        b = b + 5;
        translate([40, 0, 0])
        cube(b, center=true);
    }
}

Both shapes have size 10, because each sub-union() creates its own variable
b that shadows the global b. In C you would be able to re-assign the global
b. In this case the sphere would have d=5+5=10, and the cube would get size
5+5+5 = 15.
By swapping the order of operand a and b, the sphere would be 15 and the
cube 10.

Union() is a commutative operator, meaning that the result does not depend
on the order of the operands. Allowing reassignment breaks this fundamental
property of union().

Have a nice day,
Bananapeel :)

Yes we have been over this  before

more than  once
<http://forum.openscad.org/Assignment-semantics-td7913.html#a7999>  .

Once you grok OpenSCAD it all makes sense. 

Unless I see objections, I will start a project to change the wiki to use
'identifier', 'definition', 'constant' and 're-definable' as needed, and
point out the -D rationale. [eventually...]

You have my objection. They are variables in the mathematical sense. A
symbol that represents a quantity in a mathematical expression.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable
Variable (mathematics), a symbol that represents a quantity in a
mathematical expression, as used in many sciences
Variable (computer science), a symbolic name associated with a value and
whose associated value may be changed

I'm comfortable with calling them variables, but I suppose they could be
called parameters instead. The wikipedia definition suggests that
"parameter" might be appropriate in a mathematical sense:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter#Mathematical_functions

"Mathematical functions have one or more arguments that are designated in
the definition by variables. A function definition can also contain
parameters, but unlike variables, parameters are not listed among the
arguments that the function takes. When parameters are present, the
definition actually defines a whole family of functions, one for every valid
set of values of the parameters."

The Variable wikipedia page defines parameters as a subclass of variables:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_%28mathematics%29#Specific_kinds_of_variables

"To distinguish them, the variable x is called a unknown, and the other
variables are called parameters or coefficients, or sometimes constants,
although this last terminology is incorrect for an equation and should be
reserved for the function defined by the left-hand side of this equation."

It also works well with calling OpenSCAD files "parametric designs".
However, "parameters" and "unknowns" are indistinguishable in code (and in a
formula, for that matter), which would make explaining the difference a
little bit more difficult to a naive person: unknowns appear in the argument
list of the function.

The "constants" that are used in OpenSCAD cannot be changed, so they are 
not "variable" or "variables".

These discussions about "variables" come up once a month.  They consume 
time. And they frustrate many people away from OpenSCAD (I assume that 
for every newbie who persists in asking questions here, a dozen simply 
give up and wander off).

In my opinion, the OpenSCAD community needs to explain the language in a 
way that is accessible to the average programmer (think "C" rather than 
"declarative") without many newbies having to re-invent the variable 
wheel.  The discussion around OpenSCAD " variables" in the 
manual/documentation needs to include the meat of the discussions that 
we have on a regular basis with newbies.

Yes, but using  the mathematical definition contributed to this problem.

To the layperson variable usually implies, in this context,  a programming
variable. While that person is also wrong, I think it is pragmatic to avoid
confusion in the users if it is inexpensive to do so.

I disagree with your objections. If they are variables in mathemarical sense, they are also constants in mathematical sense. Since they are constants in programing sense too, i see broader apeal in simply calling them constants and avoid controvercy.

I don't know any normal language that would automatically allow
vsum([1,2,3,8]) and vsum([[1,2],[3,4]]) into the same function and give a
sensible result. They have different types. One is a vector of integers, the
other is a vector of vector or integers. That's like applying an integer
function to a string and expecting it to magically figure out what you want.

Would you expect the result to be 10 or [4, 6]?

Every other language without destructive update operator (c-style assign)
calls them variables, I don't see why OpenSCAD should be different.

They aren't "constant", because a constant is a value that never changes.
function square(s) = s*s;
b = 6;
a = square(b);
The variable a's value isn't constant - it changes according to the value of
b.

What's really needed is:
* Giving an error message when trying to redefine a variable.
* Clean up other doubtful cases.
* An explanation for people from procedural programming languages (C-style).
* Push all these changes to release version.

Have a nice day,
Bananapeel :)

Hmm, I am no expert, but in your example below, 'a' is not varying, it 
is constant - it gets calculated once and set up for use.

It would only be a variable if it varies during the program run, eg if 
'b' changes at certain points in time....but openscad never 'runs' it 
just puts the STL together, and 'b' is always the same.

The main page of the manual:
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual
refers to an openscad source file as a script. The word script makes it
sound iterative to me. Is there a better way to explain it?

"Anonymous scopes are not considered scopes":
{
    angle = 45;
}

IMO this should be a separate scope, or give an error.

Which is what many languages do.

What matters is that the function is defined sensibly and behaviour
defined for that type and to be useful.

Eg is the average of  matrix of 3D co-ordinates more usefully a set of
vectors or a single point giving the "middle" (for that definition) of the
object ?

Here is a version that works with vectors and vectors of vectors:

function sum(v, i = 1) = i < len(v) ? v[i] + sum(v, i+1) : len(v) ? v[0] :
0;


echo(sum([]));

echo(sum([1,2,3,8]));

echo(sum([[1,2],[3,4]]));


ECHO: 0

ECHO: 14

ECHO: [4, 6]

line 64 is

Please advise

This kind of artifact tends to be due to buggy OpenGL drivers. If you update
the drivers for your GPU to the latest version, it might work better.
It's just a visual artifact - it won't affect your design.

In a functional programming language, a 'constant' is an expression
like '42' which always has the same value, in every run of the
program. A 'variable' is a named value that can have different values
in different runs of the program. Even if you have a top level
definition like
    x = 0;
this can still vary, in OpenSCAD, because you can override the value
'0' in several ways, eg by invoking openscad with -Dx=1.

Like Bananapeel said, OpenSCAD is a functional programming language.
There are many others, such as Haskell, Ocaml, F#, ML, Erlang, and so
on. The word 'variable' is used in all of these languages to describe
what OpenSCAD calls a variable. And there isn't really a good
alternative to the word 'variable'. So we need to do what Bananapeel
said: fix the documentation and fix the error reporting so that
OpenSCAD can be more easily understood by people coming from an
imperative programming background.

Thank you for the advice.

Has anyone else bumped into this issue in the latest dev builds where they

It's actually due to a missing convexity parameter to the linear_extrude. 
convexity = 2 fixes it.

Wops, sorry - you?re totally right!


Just for reference:
Another way of getting correct rendering is Preferences->Advanced->Force Goldfeather
This will cause lower rendering performance but may improve rendering on certain hardware.

Can you share a design?
This warning is new, but it might be that we?re issuing it too liberally.

You need a development snapshot of OpenSCAD to see that example.

I'm using version = [2014, 6, 29].
The following changes made it work for me:

// posx = position(a);

color("black")

translate([position(a)[0], position(a)[1], -3*r])

cube([0.8, 0.8, 0.2], center = true);


With a newer build the assignment in blocks does work, I believe.


In the code, maybe someone could add a line about what version of OpenSCAD
is required to run it?


Sincerely,


TakeItAndRun

 %for (a = [ 0 : 0.004 : 1]) assign(pos = position(a)){


Is a better fix for older versions to avoid calling position twice.

You should be able to validate that yourself. Everything that I wrote was
valid OpenSCAD code, and formed a complete instruction set. If you want a
specific answer, I could argue that yes it does work. The return result is
"undef", which is a perfectly reasonable return result for such a function
applied to a vector of vectors.

I wrote my function to fit roughly the same signature as that of Joymaker
(although admittedly that signature was for mean rather than sum). It's
obvious what is expected for a single vector of integers, but less obvious
when that vector includes other non-integer elements. It would be possible
for me to write a function that properly delves into the depths of the
vector and does something more useful, but its behaviour for that would
depend on the thoughts of the person who uses the function. I notice that R
will flatten any [simple] vectors when calculating means and sums:

> a <- c(c(1,2,c(6,4)),c(3,4)); mean(a);
[1] 3.333333

But what about complex numbers? What if I want to put a function in as one
of the arguments? What about string values? What about oversized input? What
about blocking input? What about non-deterministic input? Sure, you can
provide answers to these, but designing a function to cover every
conceivable [mis]use is silly.

This is a nitpicky and offtopic rant which is largely unrelated to the issue
of how to name OpenSCAD variables, but perhaps at least demonstrates that
nuances of programming languages mean problems of interpretation can't
necessarily be fixed for everyone. I don't see how we can keep the
mathematical purists happy, while at the same time explaining things in a
"read once, understand everything" fashion, as well as keeping debate to a
minimum so that the bowls of petunias don't get annoyed with pointless
banter.

Could you post a screenshot? I don?t quite understand how your can ?lose? the top and bottom of an image.
Note that OpenSCAD tends to struggle with importing large STL files. Your 3D scanner software (or any 3D scanner software) is likely to do a much better job at this. If OpenSCAD acts up, one common solution is to run through a polygon reduction process on it, e.g. using MeshLab.

Floating point numbers are used. These have rounding errors. To combat that
you should try to make your shapes involved in the difference() operation a
little bit bigger.

// No
difference() {
    cube(2);
    cube(1.5);
}

translate([5, 0, 0])
// YES
difference() {
    cube(2);
    translate([-0.1, -0.1, -0.1]) cube(1.5+0.1);
}

And a cube shouldn't take $fn as a parameter.

I hope this solves your problem.

No, I don't think this is it. These are your problem:
    *translate([0,.5,-6]) cylinder(1,d=20, center=true); 
    *translate([0,1.5,-3]) cylinder(1,d=20, center=true); 
    *translate([0,1.5,0]) cylinder(1,d=20, center=true); 
    *translate([0,1.5,3]) cylinder(1,d=20, center=true); 
    *translate([0,.5,6]) cylinder(1,d=20, center=true); 

No idea why.

It looks like that button tries to turn off mail delivery using a mailman command, but since it doesn?t know people?s mailman passwords, it will fail. No idea how that?s supposed to work..

The problem is that your cylinders with diameter 20 are subtracted from a
cube with size 20. Since the edges of the cylinders exactly touch the cube,
you get an infinitely thin wall some places in your design.
Make these cylinders 19.9 or smth., and it should improve.
Note that this is just a warning. 3D printing software will typically be
able to process this file just fine, perhaps with a few warnings.

NB! In general, you want to make negative objects protrude a little bit from
the positive one. That will also make previews less flickering.

It used to work before you moved the mailing list. Maybe it is possible to
turn off authentication.

    translate([0,.5,6]) cylinder(1,d=20+c, center=true);

}

The problem is that it's no longer precisely the same shape. There are small
holes in your walls. You could make the cylinders smaller instead of bigger,
but you'd get places where the walls are very thin, which would be a problem
for some materials.

Thanks!
We did report excessive confusing warnings. I?ve reduced the amount of warning output for cases like yours.
The next snapshot will include the fix.

Bump.

Could someone please tell me how to tell Openscad where to find Qt?

I now have 10 dependencies resolved but even though I have Qt4.5.3 on my
system, check-dependencies.sh still says that qt is "unknown".

I installed Qt as a package and it went to /opt/aard/Qt4.  I already have
/opt/aard/qt4 in my PATH but that doesn't seem to help.

???

I don?t think check-dependencies can locate packages outside the standard directories.
However, the build system will pick up Qt even if check-dependencies doesn?t, as we use a different lookup there.

Your PATH is set correctly if you can run qmake.

Blows up how?
On which OS?

It works for me, both in 2014.03 and the latest dev snapshot.
I?d recommend testing the latest dev snapshot (http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html#snapshots).

If you still have problems, we?ll look into it - just need some more info about what happens.

/"I don?t think check-dependencies can locate packages outside the standard
directories."/

What is the standard directory for Qt?  You'd think they'd tell you
somewhere on the Qt website, but I couldn't find it.  I tried building Qt
from source but their Makefile doesn't work for me.  The prebuilt package
does seem to work but it installed itself in a funny place.

/"the build system will pick up Qt even if check-dependencies doesn?t"/

Thanks - that's good to know.

/"Your PATH is set correctly if you can run qmake."/

And thanks for mentioning that too - looks like I don't even have qmake. 
check-dependencies wants to see "make" but says nothing about qmake.  Or is
that what it means by "make"?

We search here:

qmake is part of Qt. Look through your Qt installation and see where the qmake binary is. That?s where your PATH needs to be pointed to.

Message-ID: <EF56DEA7-C100-4BCA-9E1F-EA6A6B34976B@kintel.net>

Hi all,

Thanks for testing out first Release Candidate. We?ve fixed a number of issues (see below).

Please consider the current master branch and snapshot binaries >= 2015.02.05 the second Release Candidate of OpenSCAD 2015.02. 

As usual, we?re planning to give it a week or so for testing before making a release, unless significant enough bugs or regressions surface, in which case the whole process will have to rinse and repeat until we?re content. 

Please give it a spin and pour your complaints here or on the github issue tracker. 

Thanks, 

-Marius

Yes, I just figured that out :-).  I guess I was updating my previous post
when you wrote that.  I'll just assume that Qt is satisfied now.

At this point all I have left are:

qscintilla2
cgal - has 7 more dependencies I need
opencsg
glew - make failed
gcc - make failed
make

Since you?re already building, I assume you have a compiler and make, so you can consider those resolved.

Are you maybe using the 32-bit version of OpenSCAD? That
2.5GB is suspiciously near the limit for 32-bit applications.

What happens with the dev-snapshot version?

Good point!  There is nothing about 32 vs 64 in the Help About for the

Where would I find a Win 8 64-bit installer for the dev snapshot, please?

They?re linked from http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html#snapshots

http://files.openscad.org/snapshots/OpenSCAD-2015.02.05-x86-64-Installer.exe
http://files.openscad.org/snapshots/OpenSCAD-2015.02.05-x86-64.zip

The zip file is sometimes more convenient - you can just run OpenSCAD from the unpacked zip file.

Btw., I just tested on Win 8.1 in a 32-bit VM, and both versions of OpenSCAD worked perfectly.
Are you sure you posted the crashing design?

/"glew should really only require OpenGL.."/

It failed in a very strange way.  I've opened a support ticket over there if
you want to see what happened.  It's ugly and involves relocation overflows,
whatever they are.

http://sourceforge.net/p/glew/bugs/267/

/'Since you?re already building, I assume you have a compiler and make, so
you can consider those resolved.'/

Well I do have gcc, but it's version 3.4.4.  The script says it wants at
least 4.2.  This is a tough one.  The gcc make takes over eight hours to
complete on my Sun Blade 2500 and I don't get the error until the very end. 
I can't really tweak random stuff hoping for a fix if it takes that long to
see if it helps.  I do however have a current copy of Solaris Studio 12.4. 
Is there some reason Openscad can't be compiled with that instead of gcc?

When I do "which make" it says "GNU Make 4.1".  The script says it wants
"make 3".  Can I assume that gmake 4.1 satisfies "make 3"?

Yes, I am sure that I sent you the bad code.

I just tried it on the latest. Stunning.  Amazing.  So, SO, SOOOO FAST.

My hat is off to you all.  Wonderful.

Here's a potential problem.  I'm working on CGAL now.  It says it needs LEDA
(plus 6 more).  But the download page for LEDA
(www.algorithmic-solutions.info/fre/d5.php) only lists Linux files and they
all have "i386" in their names.  Is this a show-stopper for my Sparc build?

For the source code, they say they want 3000 euros.  Boo wah hah hah hah. 
/That's/ not gonna happen.

Um, what's the difference between http://forum.openscad.org/ and
http://www.openscad.org/community.html?

Turns out that they both can be logged in using the same id, they have the
same information, but they are different.

Confused...

Those two are the same, on is just on a iframe on the OpenSCAD web page.

It is a  nabble forum <http://www.nabble.com/>  .
It uses mailman as its mailing list  here
<http://lists.openscad.org/mailman/listinfo/discuss_lists.openscad.org>  . 

As I got your above post, you are now subscribed to that mailing list.

/"Looks optional to me."/

Oops - right you are.  The whole process has gotten so complex I set up a
OneNote table to keep track of all the pieces needed.  I've just gotten so
used to automatically copying stuff into that I completely missed the giant
heading that said "optional".  Duh.

Thanks.

Any decent C++ compiler should do. The current code should be C++03 compatible, so given that your compiler is < 12 years old you have a decent chance. Nobody have tried though, and all dependencies are likely to have to be recompiled as I don?t think Sun?s compiler is ABI compatible with gcc.

I?m pretty sure it will. I haven?t used GNU make 4 myself though.

Well that's interesting.  It did show up as being accepted.  Hmmm.  However,
community.html is still complaining that I need to subscribe.

It looks like all your posts made it to the list though.
The only exception was the post titled ?Subscribe?. The list held that back since ?Subscribe? is a mailing list admin keyword

Unfortunately,CGAL also failed to build.  I've started a thread on their

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Why is for so slow?
Message-ID: <1423206391520-11511.post@n5.nabble.com>

Below is an example of when I use a for loop, the preview is SUPER SLOW
compared to when I do the same thing manually.



Set /useFor /to *true *and rotating around the object is disgustingly slow
compared to if /*useFor=false*/.  This is just an example. It gets worse
when I add more spheres to this in the union.  Funny thing is, the letters
can be totally engulfed in the spheres so that they don't show up, and it is
still slow.  Something going wrong with the caching?  What's going on? 

Using OpenSCAD version 2015.01.23 (git 5a0c4b0).

a. If this was just the first time, it needs to build the font cache. As it
seems you have tried a few things I assume that is not the cause.

b. for me, on the same version, it is fine. (W7/64bit)

c. "the letters can be totally engulfed in the spheres so that they don't
show up, and it is still slow." even tho they are engulfed, they still need
calculating to know they are engulfed. But as it is not slow for me...

d. What H/W and S/W platform? (check your graphics drivers are up to date).

My SW (OS) is Win7.  My hardware is an older (3-4 yo) Dell Inspiron N411Z
laptop with 8GB RAM, 1TB 5400RPM HD, i4-2450M CPU @ 2.5GHz with built in
Intel HD Graphics Family video. 

I'll see if I can get any driver updates, but the fact that it is slower on
my machine indicates a significant run time path divergence. 

Turns out the slowdown is caused by the interaction of the /for loop/ with
the /intersection()/ of the /heart()/ in /letters()/.  Without the
/intersection()/, the problem isn't seen.  See the following (this is a be
complete sample):


Now you should see some slowdown.  I removed a sphere in the heart() module
because the programme almost died (even comes close with 3 spheres).

Yes, I see the slowdown now. But in all honesty, the way you're doing
debugging is wrong. You're not creating the shortest code to show the
problem, and testing the role of the for loop incorrectly.

Thank about it: to test if the for loop is the problem, you should expand it
manually and see if you get a difference. for (i=[0:3]) { module(i); }
should be expanded to union() { module(0); module(1); module(2); module(3);
} to test if the for loop is the problem.

You put completely different code inside the for loop and the else
(useFor=0) branch. Of course the timing is going to be different. It's
executing different code. It has nothing to do with the for loop.

This code should test the for loop, and show that using a loop vs. writing
the code manually has no impact on speed (both are slow):
d=5;

module heart()
{
  scale([1,.5,1])
  {
      translate([-d*3/4,0,0])
      sphere(r=d, $fn=30);
      translate([d*3/4,0,0])
      sphere(r=d, $fn=30);
      *translate([0,0,d*3/4])
      sphere(r=d, $fn=30);
      translate([0,0,-d*3/4])
      sphere(r=d, $fn=30);
  }
}

module torus(majorR, minorR)
{
  rotate_extrude(convexity = 10, $fn=50)
  translate([majorR,0,0])
  circle(r=minorR, $fn=30);
}

module part(useFor)
{
  scale(1)
  //rotate([0,180,0])
  {
    difference()
    {
      d=0.4;
      o=0.2;
      heart();

      if (useFor)
      {
        for(i=[0:3])
        {
          letters(i, o=o, d=d);
        }
        translate([0,0,21])
        rotate([90,0,0])
        torus(19, .8);
      }
      else
      {
        union()
        {

          letters(0, o=o, d=d);
          letters(1, o=o, d=d);
          letters(2, o=o, d=d);
          letters(3, o=o, d=d);

        }
        translate([0,0,21])
        rotate([90,0,0])
        torus(19, .8);
      }
    }
*    for(i=[0:3])
      letters(i, 0);
  }
}

function RTTs(i) = [
  [[ 87,0,0],   [-9/2-.4, -2, 1.5], "AA"],
  [[103,0,0],   [-2,      -7, 2  ], "B" ],
  [[ 87,0,180], [-9/2-.4, -2, 1.5], "CC"],
  [[103,0,180], [-2,      -7, 2  ], "D" ]
][i];

module letters(i,o,d=0)
{
  scale(1)
  intersection()
  {
    heart();
    
    rotate(RTTs(i)[0])
    translate(RTTs(i)[1]+[0,0,-d])
    linear_extrude(height=1+d)
    offset(delta=o)
    text(RTTs(i)[2], size=5);
  }
}

part(useFor=0);

Have a nice day,

I guess what this exhaustive and very helpful answer "SunPro is
no supported compiler." on your post means is that you have
to tell cmake to not pick up the system compiler at /usr/bin/CC
but instead the gcc you are using otherwise.

That should work by adding parameters to the cmake call:

cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++

(depending on the installation it might need the full path)

ciao,

1. not sure given the height difference.  Might look weird.

2. Yeah, that's kinda odd.  Between Console title and the Console's text,
there's a double line, but that doesn't exist for Editor title and Editor's
text.  The double line should go above the Console title.

3. Agreed.

Right, so its the intersection() that's the problem.  The "loop" had more
intersection() operations then the non-loop, causing a slow down.

Thanks,

Still, after generating the code, I would have expected that the data
vertices and faces would have been cached and not have to  redo them every
time the POV changes.

If that would be the case, that would rate as serious issue. As it does
not seem that extreme for others, it's probably "just" the actual
drawing.

Sounds like you want some sort of variation of this:



This takes a set of points in ccw order (from above) and then appends
another set of points in ccw order (from above) and creates a skin from
that. If the direction is -ve in the z-axis, the side wall faces will be
flipped.

Sorry, this is not production code and was actually a test for something
else, but I think you can get the idea.

When I say from above, I mean looking back on the direction vector to the
face.

Side walls are correctly oriented so long as the direction vector is going
in the direction as the starting inner face.

Well I clearly have far too much time invested in this to just give up now. 
I refuse to let this program get the better of me.

However I am also mindful of the guy who tried to get to the moon by
climbing a tree and was pleased because each new branch climbed brought him
closer to his goal.

F5 does not generate a polygon, for that you need F6 - which gives much
better performance when it's done.

F5 uses some trickery to display the shapes without calculating much
beforehand.

The reason it?s slow is due to how preview works.

This is hard to explain, but in essence, having intersections as the negative objects in difference is expensive.
The preview rendering algorithm only allows having primitive objects as negatives, and everything else has to be unpacked.
For example:
  A - B*C - D*E
becomes:
  A-B-D + A-B-E + A-C-D + A-C-E

..and if A is more complex:
  A+B - C*D - E*F
becomes: 
  A-C-E + A-C-F + A-D-E + A-D-F + B-C-E + B-C-F + B-D-E + B-D-F

As you can see, all combinations has to be rendered, which can take some time, especially on older GPUs, and especially on low-end Intel GPUs.
As Torsten hinted at, we could optimize rendering a lot, but it could be better to optimize the design.

In your particular case, you?re essentially doing this:

(A+B+C) - (A+B+C)*X - (A+B+C)*Y - (A+B+C)*Z - (A+B+C)*W
..where A,B and C are spheres and X, Y, Z, W are extruded letters
(ignoring the torus for simplicity)

I?ll make a mental leap and say that this is equivalent to
(A+B+C) - X - Y -Z -W

i.e., your intersections are not necessary.
Try that and you?ll see a substantial speedup

 -Marius

LOL.  He is definitely a man of few words.  But I suppose he could have just
said RTFM or even not bothered to reply at all.  In any event thank you for
providing the real answer with:


"cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ "

That worked fine and allowed cmake to complete.  However it still had an
error about halfway through xcomplaining about "libmpfr.so: wrong ELF class:
ELFCLASS64".  And when I did gmake afterwards, it also complained about the
same thing.

Now I did install MPFR from a prebuilt package so it's possible there's
something in there it didn't like.  (What is it with Unix and elves anyway?) 
It's not clear from the error, but I'm assuming it found a 32 bit library
but wants 64 bits.  In any case, I'm recompiling MPFR, this time from
source.  Then we'll go back to CGAL.  One more branch up the tree...

I'm not aware of an existing FAQ, so I've collected some of the latest

https://github.com/openscad/openscad/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions

What other questions/answers should be added?

(In case it starts growing too big, I'll probably move it somewhere

Right, that's certainly a FAQ too. I guess the answer is basically the same as 
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#why-is-my-imported-stl-file-only-showing-up-with-f5-but-not-f6

And talking about errors, the line number problem is probably also worth to mention.

Indeed. Setting it to 1 slows it down (~3sec), and after the preview the
computer becomes sticky (unable to pan or zoom), followed by crash of
openscad. :(

In my notation:

A-B = difference() { A();  B(); }
A*B = intersection() { A(); B(); }

I've just retested all five of the files previously provided in this thread
using version 2015.02.05 (git 37421bb). The previous "PolySet has degenerate
polygons" warnings are no longer displayed. However, Slic3r only manages to
properly render the "RollTopBoxInsert" STL results. The other four resulting
STL files either result in broken images when viewed in Slic3r or crash out
before allowing the object to be viewed. All five files were able to be
rendered to STL and subsequently processed by Slic3r using 2014.03 .

I just tested exporting all those .scad files to STL and subsequently using Slic3r to G-code.
I didn?t notice any issues with that process.

Could you provide some more info about which system you?re running this, which version of Slic3r, and how it ?crashes out? ?

After more poking around, it appears that the Qt4.5.3 package I installed was
32 bit rather than 64 bit.  I'm guessing that this may be what CGAL was
complaining about with those "wrong ELFCLASS" errors.

I already know I couldn't install Qt5.2 so I downloaded Qt 4.6.4 and
compiled that.  The ./configure went OK (though with a bunch of warnings)
but the gmake failed with two errors.  I started a new thread over at

http://qt-project.org/forums/viewthread/52895/

with the sad results.

I'm afraid I really need help at this point.  Qt is the last big sticking
point.  I'm hoping that if I can get that to work, CGAL will work and then I
can install OpenCSG.  That will be the last of the dependencies.  But
nothing happens until I can get Qt to go.

I'm not familiar with the Qt code base, so the following comments
might not be correct.

I find it suspicious that you are compiling an old version of Qt
(4.6.4, released in 2011) with the latest version of gcc (4.9.2, Oct
2014). My experience with gcc makes me wonder if these releases are
compatible.

The company I work for has a large C++ project (hundreds of thousands
of code lines, at least), and every time we upgrade to a new version
of gcc, we spend about a month fixing the code so that it will compile
with this new version. Most of the work is eliminating new warnings
that our code never used to trigger, but there are also new compile
time errors that we need to fix.

Message-ID: <CAEEmnrNiaMC-OkPk+m0a_Szxi7PLn4xZk1Gv0A1JonpRQKTBTA@mail.gmail.com>

I started playing with the latest Win32 dev snapshot and immediately
noticed I have to get much closer to the object to get it to appear the
same size and it then gives a fish eye view.

Is this an intentional change, if so why? Is there any way to get the same
perspective view as before?

I don't know much about photography and lenses but isn't there a standard
camera setup that matches the human eye so objects look natural regardless
of there size? I assume this would only be true while OpenScad units
corresponded to mm.

Thanks, we'll have a look. I don't think any devs have a touch-capable
computer, but we can look at it conceptually. We'll get back to you if we
have something you can test.

Is this causing problems for you, does it look ugly, or is it mostly that you?re not used to it?

Message-ID: <CAEEmnrO3v5a-bUOsXSFEudDX8n4ru1jf1fUaqpVh-5bvbL_Z2w@mail.gmail.com>

When I use file open I now get a new window with the previous file still
open in the old window. It seems to be the same OpenScad instance though as
I can't work on one file while the other is rendering, or even close it.

This isn't my expected behaviour on Windows. I expect file open to replace
the current file in the same window. I expect a second window to be a new
instance, not tied to the first one. Is this correct behaviour on a Mac or
more recent versions of Windows, I haven't used anything past 7. Or is is
an OpenScad anomaly?

Can't comment on OpenScad, but Office 2013 (Tested Excel) running on
Windows 8 does this:

1) Create New. Add data, don't save.
2) File New, as expected opens a new window.
3) File Open, also opens a new window leaving the original window open
   and with its data in.

Notepad++ does the same and looks more traditional. I think it's just
different behaviour from ye olde apps.

If you have ?Advanced->Allow to open multiple documents? enabled, it will be possible to have multiple documents open in the same process.
One one document can render at the same time.

We don?t have a way of managing multiple instances. To do that, disable that feature and do what you used to do.

I don't think it is case of what I am used to, other than my own eyes. It
gives a fish eye view of my objects because to make them fill the view I
have to move the camera very close. The image it gives then corresponds to
placing my eye that close and it filling my field of view. It is then shown
on a small part of a screen or a printed page viewed at arms length. That
is why it looks wrong as it might be a similar size to the real object held
at arms length but is a picture of it from inches away.

I am not sure what the correct solution is. I suppose it does the same as a
real camera would if you photograph something small such that it fills the
picture without using zoom, so perhaps it is correct. Since I use it to
automatically build a manual it would mean going through every image and
repositioning the camera. Possibly the camera should have a zoom parameter.

I'm looking at this over on the issues site:

I can't replicate, if you could provide some additional info about your
machine and OS at that link, it would be helpful.

Thanks,

Here is an example of an 80mm fan duct:

The old version looks like I would actually see a fan duct in front of me.



The new one looks a close up photo, which I would not see with my own eyes
unless I held up up to my face.

I did an A/B test of the two pictures, flickering them back and forth, 
and I cannot see the differences that bother you.  That said I would 
imagine that adding a Zoom parameter for the "lens" would be fairly 
simple, and would resolve this quickly.

They look like two different projections to me, not just different view 
points.  The upper one looks like a pictorial orthographic projection 
and the lower one a perspective projection.

/"Are you *sure* that it was compiling with gcc? "/

No, I'm not.  How do I tell?

This is what otho looks like. It looks bigger at the back because it is the
same as the front but you brain expects perspective.

gcc 3.4.3 sounds pretty old. Why are you using such an old version of
QT 4? Why not use QT 4.8.3, which was released April 2014? Okay, I've
never tried to build OpenSCAD, but using recent versions of QT4 and
gcc makes more sense to me, for building the most recent version of
OpenSCAD.

She was having trouble getting newer versions to compile too, I thought. Or
was because it was the same version as her precompiled package.

Okay, I went back through this thread, and I see Michele was having
build issues with recent versions of Qt due to "gar/category.mk" not
being present. I did a google search for "gar/category.mk" and there
are a number of hits. It seems to be a Solaris/OpenCSW thing, and
there seems to be a reasonable amount of information about it how to
get it and install it. For example,
https://automatthias.wordpress.com/category/computers/opencsw/

/"gcc 3.4.3 sounds pretty old."/

That's what came with the Solaris 10U11 DVD.  And since the Openscad
dependency checked wanted at least 4.0 I figured why not just go to the
latest and installed 4.9.2.

"using recent versions of QT4 and
gcc makes more sense to me, for building the most recent version of
OpenSCAD. "

I tried both Qt5.2 and Qt5.4 at first.  Neither of them will even run
./configure.  They stop instantly with the oh-so-helpful message

./configure: test: argument expected

I posted about this on qt-project.org but never got an answer.  So then I
decided to install a Qt 4.5.3 package I found since I was having no luck
compiling it.  That seemed to work and I was able to run a few examples in
the Qt directory.  But when I tried to compile CGAL (which apparently needs
Qt) I started getting bad ELF errors from gmake.  So I checked my Qt and
found it was 32 bit instead of 64.  So I deleted it and then downloaded
4.6.4 so that there would be no confusion between it and the one I'd just
dumped.  I thought as long as it was > 4.4 which is the minimum for
Openscad, I'd be OK.

At least ./configure worked with 4.6.4, but with a bunch of warnings.  And
then gmake failed with two errors.

Cheers, I commented, I can't reproduce it now. Touch is working... It
didn't work on two separate days though, so I didn't imagine it (unless
I imagined it twice...)

Hardware is a Dell xps15, so nothing out of the ordinary.

Cheers for looking into it so quickly. Ian

"She was having trouble getting newer versions to compile too, I thought. Or
was because it was the same version as her precompiled package. "

THe precompiled package turned out to be 32 bit.  It was not mentioned on
the page where I found the link, nor was in included in the file name.  So I
guess now I pretty much have to compile /some /version of Qt > 4.4 but < 5.0
(unless someone can tell me what "test: argument expected" means.

But the "which compiler" question may be a clue.  I just found this:


That looks like the dreaded no supported Solaris Studio, yes?

And the very first thing the Qt4.6 ./configure does is call CC.  So maybe
that's the problem.

I figured out how to tell gmake which gcc to use.  How do I tell configure
which CC to use?

"Okay, I went back through this thread, and I see Michele was having
build issues with recent versions of Qt due to "gar/category.mk" not
being present. I did a google search for "gar/category.mk" and there
are a number of hits. It seems to be a Solaris/OpenCSW thing, and
there seems to be a reasonable amount of information about it how to
get it and install it."

I got embroiled with gar when I tried to install the Opencsw package of Qt
after failing repeatedly to compile it myself.  But apparently all the Qt
install scripts over at Opencsw require that you have something called "gar"
which near as I can tell is some sort of package creation/distribution tool. 
So I tried to install gar and it was a complete disaster.  I read every
single post on the web about category.mk but nothing worked.

Since nothing else in Openscad seems to require gar, I decided to abandon
the idea of loading the Opencsw Qt package and concentrate instead on
getting some version of Qt > 4.4 to compile.  Right now that is the
rate-determining step.  If Qt falls, then CGAL and OpenCSG should follow in
short order, thus finally letting me out of Dependency Hell.

RollTopBoxBase.stl <http://forum.openscad.org/file/n11572/RollTopBoxBase.stl>  
I'm running under Windows 7 Pro with the latest MS patches. I'm using Slic3r
v1.1.7 (64 bit) which claims to be the latest version according to its
internal update facility. The design that causes the instant crash of Slic3r
is "RollTopBoxBase.stl" which I've attached to this post. Slic3r aborts
within a second of telling it to load that STL. The error popup simply
states "slic3r has stopped working ... Windows is checking for a solution
...". This isn't a problem with the gcode output as it never got that far.

I appreciate your attention on this issue. I'm looking forward to the next
release of OpenSCAD being most feature rich and stable version to date.

There is only a slight change between Orthogonal/Perspective in 2014.03

The 2015 Perspective is wrong.
I don't know what the distance difference means.

I don't the perspective is wrong as such. It is correct when viewed from
the much shorter distance needed to make it fill the view. It is just that
humans don't normally view objects so close to the eye, only cameras do
when taking close ups.

Right, so basically, we set up a camera and render the object using that camera, but we don?t take into account that people look at the object on a screen, which doesn?t fill their entire field of view.
When refactoring the camera code, we set the camera field of view to 90 degress, which is pretty standard. I?ll look into finding a better value.
I?m not sure what it was earlier - the code was a bit convoluted.

RollTopBoxBase.scad
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n11578/RollTopBoxBase.scad>  
I appreciate the mesh analysis and repair. Here's the scad source. My main
concern at this point is that this file can be output to STL and
subsequently processed into GCODE using Slic3r when the 2014.03 version of
OpenSCAD is used. There seems to be extra accommodation required when
processing using the latest development build of OpenSCAD.

Although 2015.02.05 seems faster at compiling and rendering the preview it
seems much less responsive after that. The GUI is barely usable when a
large model is loaded. Older versions such as 2013.06 are much better in
that respect.

Is this expected or a bug / regression?

There was a rendering bug fixed that slowed down the preview in the process.

Could you point to an example, so I can make some tests?

We generally try to avoid performance regressions. In particular for previews.
We did end up with some lower performance in a few places due to the need to triangulate almost planar faces. That would introduce a slight function call overhead while rendering.

You had a lot of co-incident faces, I tried to comment, with original
values, where I changed comething.
But there was a lot of trial/error so some may have been missed.

When you see things like the following, it generally indicates something is
wrong.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Heads up. View jumps when rotating/translating with mouse
Message-ID: <1423535522018-11584.post@n5.nabble.com>

It has happened a few times now, manipulating the object with the mouse and
it jumps more than half the window width. I think it was back to where it
was, but not certain.

Can't get my finger on it, so heads up here, in case others notice it too.

It was a fairly simple model so it isn't likely to be rendering performance,
more like getting a wrong mouse position maybe.

Have you tried export to AMF? I think there is an odd bug with stl export
that showed up after 2014.03.

I ran afoul of it when trying to build parts from the Prusa i3 repo.

Everything worked out fine with AMF but STL had weird degenerate faces.

I have an issue open on github but haven't been able to run the problem
down any further (such as with a bisect), as there a lot of intermediary
commits that segfault.

Thanks Joseph, the above is the fixed version and some pointers for John on

In addition to any OpenSCAD issue, this is a bug in Slic3r (which triggers only on Windows apparently), and should be reported to them as well.
I?m continuing to look into how to avoid such problems when exporting from OpenSCAD.

You got it almost right:
linear_extrude(height = 300, twist = -360) translate([0, 10, 0]) circle(r =
1);

You don't want to center, since a centered linear extrude centers the entire
resulting 3D object in the origin. Apart from that, you only got the X and Y
of the initial translation mixed up, and the twist inverted (the twist
direction is not very logic I know)

PS! Look up the % and # operators. They are good for debugging such things.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] openSCAD as a programming language - testamonial
Message-ID: <1423652370371-11590.post@n5.nabble.com>

I see debate again about whether openSCAD can be a proper programming
language without assignment  The thing is that openSCAD is a functional
language like many others.  I also use XQuery to develop entire web
applications and it too is functional.

For the past month I've been working on code to implement the Conway
polyhedra operators in openSCAD.  There are implementations in JavaScript
and Python but not AFAIK in openSCAD or in a functional language.  

The script is on Github
https://github.com/KitWallace/openscad/blob/master/conway.scad and now
implements all but one of the operators (cant get my head around whirl!) 
with some additions such as a shell operation.  The script enables complex
polyhedra to be constructed entirely in 'user-space' (is that the right
term?) as points and faces until turned into a solid via polyhedron().  The
code could do with some re-factoring but I think it is a good example of the
power of openSCAD and functional languages in general. 

Development has been greatly eased by recent enhancements, particularly list
comprehensions and let(), and by my realization that search() facilitates
associative arrays.  Aside from a few functions summing values in an array
where reduce() would avoid the need for recursion, I never missed
assignment.  Programming in a functional language does however need a
different mindset which takes time to acquire.

OpenSCAD as a language has made huge advances since I started using it a
couple of years ago and my thanks go out to the team for a great project. Of
course, function parameters are top of my list for further work to make
openSCAD more fully functional.

Chris

I noticed it rendering Mendel90. You could download it from git and open
scad/main.scad and press F5.

It seems to take about 5 seconds to render a frame when you drag with the
mouse. 2013.06 takes about 1 second. That still seems poor when most
objects have render() statements in them, so should just be a mesh to draw.

Even a relatively simple design with only four render()ed parts chugs at
about one frame per second whereas it pans and rotates in real time with
the old version.

An odd thing I noticed is OpenScad seems to use about 80% of one core even
when it is minimised and doing nothing. This is true of both the old and
the new version.

Also I am not sure the problem is simply slow drawing. If I drag the mouse
continuously is seems to draw a short burst of frames rapidly and then
pause for nearly a second and then repeat. It seems like it spends most of
the time doing something else. The old version will draw contiguously if I
move the mouse continuously and that revs up the graphics card fan. The new
one doesn't spend enough time drawing to do that.

That doesn?t looks like a Mendel90 part. Could you share that design?

hi,

if the design for the image that is shown is not proprietary, could you 
please post the .scad?  i'd like to see what it is that you are doing...

thanks!

Not easily because it has lots of dependencies but the render in short
bursts issue seems to be any part of Mendel90. For example bar-clamps.scad
does it.

Turning off automatic reload seems to fix the pausing issue.

I think the pausing might be proportional to the number of dependent files
when auto reload is on.

That is curious. I get ca. 5 fps on the full Mendel90 design here.
Which hardware are you using?

Also, you?re comparing to 2013.06 (which is ancient). How does 2014.03 relate to all this?
I don?t see a noticeable difference between the versions.

That would make sense. The auto-reload is checking for any changes and this feature was improved to pick up changes in dependencies too.
The dependency walking apparently takes a bit of time on some systems. We should look into using OS-specific file change notification services as they?re likely a lot faster, at least on systems which offer such services.

Anyway, I?ll have a second look at this in case there?s a bug which causes excessive checking.

Just to clarify: Does turning off Auto-reload resolve all the performance regressions you reported?

Yes, with auto reload turned off the latest version is actually much more
responsive than the old one with the full model loaded.

Older versions are fine with it turned on. The latest I have is
2014.02.25.  Do you want me to try 2014.03?

I have never updated from 2013.06 because it does everything I need. My
only desire was concat, but that didn't make it until this last one I
believe.

It seems like it is nothing to do with rendering but something to do with
looking for file changes. It doesn't rattle the disk so the file stats must
all be cached so I don't see why it would be slow.

We did fix a number of automatic reload issues in 2014.03 - I think you initiated the bug reports which led to those fixes.
This was related to burst-writing of files, as well as correctly picking up dependencies.

I?m pretty sure that the performance issues was introduced in that release.
If you could verify that 2014.03 and 2015.02-RC2 behave in the same way for you, that would indeed be very helpful.

PS! In 2015.02 we have some features which may work for you, in addition to concat (and list comprehensions):

o View All in GUI
o Ability to write to camera parameters in the .scad file
o Much faster hull() and minkowski() for common cases
o Much faster 2D pipeline

OK I will try 2014.03.

2013.06 does slow down appreciably when the full model is loaded and auto
reload is on but nowhere near as much as 2015, so I hadn't noticed it.

2015.02 reduces the first render time from 20 minutes 27 to 17 minutes 20
second, which is worth having.

The view all seems to shrink the Mendel90 excessively, perhaps because it
is tall and thin.

I noticed the load directory is no longer relative to the file that is
currently loaded. It seemed to get changed by opening a file in another
instance. This is very confusing for me because I have nearly identical
development and release directory structures so I ended up loading the
wrong version and when it takes 17 minutes that is not good. Also it is
hard to spot as there isn't much difference.

Would this be on a Windows system?

I've been bitten in the past by the brain-dead way that MS handles
directory structures. Parent (and grandparent, etc) directories with
large numbers of entries can effect access times for files.

I don't know if they have fixed that recently, but it used to be the
bane of my existence.

Probably not if you are dealing with tens or hundreds of files only and
those files are currently in use or regularly accessed. All the stat data
will be cached in memory. The one exception would be networked file
stores (where generally notifiers don't work anyway).

If you are opening the files to re-check them then depending upon the OS
and the configuration you may well cause disk writes (updating last
accessed times), which if they spin the disk up can add odd delays.

That?s a slight improvement. We didn?t improve core CSG performance, so your render() statements will still take significant time.

It?s because you have a long piece of filament sticking out. As we don?t know the exact bounding box in preview mode, we limit the bounding box to the positive objects in the scene. If you reduce your spool_holder.spool_assembly.tube_length to e.g. 250, you?ll get a better fit.

Ouch - that sounds like a bug. Do you have a way of reproducing this with a minimal example?
I might be able to do this myself, but it might be a lot of second-guessing to get there.

Thanks for testing!

2014.03 is more like the older versions. It slows a bit when auto reload is
on. If you keep the mouse moving it seems to keep rendering. If you pause
it can have a delay starting again.

This is on XP 32. As far as I remember I can stat hundreds of files per
second on the local disk.

We?re only doing stat() calls on the dependent filenames, so I agree that this sounds a bit fishy.
I?ll have to profile this to see if we?re inadvertently triggering any processing or other I/O.

Message-ID: <CAJgOqAC8K4c7aCwArH2rbW3u55atJa_KnTbTwZqbxM5Hv1kw7Q@mail.gmail.com>

The wish for reassigning variables comes again and again.
And apart from the discussion weather or not reassignment is needed or not
I would like to think about what the necessary steps would be to make it
happen.

In my simple understanding of programming, only a simple pre-execution of
the code is needed, that ignores all geometrical calculation and just
generates an intermediate code were every occurrence of a reassigned
variable is overwritten with its explicit value at that time.

Perhaps do them one at a time in the idle loop and then it would have no
impact on the GUI but scan them just as fast when it was idle. I vaguely
remember doing that when I had to check the state of lots of networked
files for a Windows app that had to notice them change and read them and
process the data.

The long tube sticking out of the top of the Mendel90 is actually cut off
with a difference here
https://github.com/nophead/Mendel90/blob/master/scad/spool_holder.scad#L385.
It is just a trick so the correct length appears on the BOM but a truncated
version in the view. I don't know an easy way of bending into the correct
shape to meet the extruder. It should not be visible past the cut but it is
in a ghostly form for some reason. I can see why it affects the view all
regardless of whether it is visible.

I will have look at the open issue again tomorrow. I may have confused
myself.

One way to think about it is that you want to turn this:

a=1;
a=a+1;
a=a+1;
myshape(a);

into:

assign(a=1)
  assign(a=a+1)
    assign(a=a+1)
      sphere(a);

..where the latter is correct OpenSCAD syntax.

While this is perfectly doable, keep in mind that one of the reasons for not changing this behavior is that cmd-line overrides using -D needs to be resolved properly, preferably in a backwards-compatible way.

One thought that occurs to me: Mendel90 has about 80 scad files and the
main.scad depends on them all directly or indirectly. All the files that
define printed parts include a config file that also includes all the
vitamins and utilities, so they are included indirectly over and over
again. A naive tree explorer or data structure could end up stat()ing the
same files over and over again. A DAG type approach like make uses is
needed to ensure each file is only stat()ed  once per pass. I haven't
looked at your source code but it could explain big delays if it is doing
many hundred stats instead of 80.

One solution for -D cmd-line would be to assign the first occurrence of the
variable to the -D parameter.

One has to think about the reassignment by libraries as well.

Perhaps it is too soon to consider some form of automatic namespacing?

Like if a is included from b.scad, you can refer to it directly as b:a?

Includes from includes could either be part of the last include's namespace
or the file they came from. So if c defines a and b includes c and the user
has included b, either still b:a or b:c:a. I am less enamored of the second
as it implies a lot more coupling to libraries.

Obviously a namespace block would be useful as well.

This, I think is a useful balance between library name collisions and
compatibility with existing  libs.

Overrides with -D are still pretty dirty (but entirely in keeping with the
syntax restrictions to its loose cousin, the c preprocessor)

Once it looks like you can do x=x+1, then you will want

if (expr)
  x=x+1;
else
  x=x+2;
cube(x);

But it really makes generating multiple prints from one file easy with
the command line version.

I have many designs with multiple STL files generated from one design
via a "plate" constant/variable. I reset on the command line to
generate the one I want. (From a Makefile, if you want to realize just
how much of a programmer I am.<shrug/>)

Not allowing the -D option would really make for a messier workflow, or
a bunch of small files that do the equivalent.

Just my 2 cents.

Perhaps I'm missing something, but I don't really get the need for 
variable re-assignment, and it seems that it would break the functional 
nature of the OpenSCAD language.

Variable mutation basically means that OpenSCAD would no longer be a 
tree-description language and would become an imperative language that 
has functions to build a geometry tree (see Josheph's comment about 
geometric python).

When these requests come up, I would suggest referring people to 
documentation about functional languages and focus the effort on making 
OpenSCAD a better functional language, as opposed to making a chimera 
that might make some folks happy in the short-term.

Well general purpose programming languages need to be able to remember and
manipulate state for a lot of applications but a description of a 3D object
is not one of them.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] How to set a limit for extended/pattern objects to be
 contained in the volume of a desired object
Message-ID: <1423720753513-11623.post@n5.nabble.com>

Here is my current setup:
module bars() 
{
	for(x=[-30,-20,-10,0,10,20,30], y=[-30,-20,-10,0,10,20,30		])

	translate([x,y,0]) cylinder (r=2,h=100,$fn=100,
	center=true);
}

difference() 
{
	bars();
	sphere(r=30);
}

How can I make it possible that the bars will only show up within the limits
of the sphere?
I don't want a solid sphere, I want to see the bars existing only within a
given shape/set of dimensions.

Thank you kindly, maybe I can help you.

Replacing difference() with intersection() should do the trick.

Message-ID: <1423818752033-11627.post@n5.nabble.com>

I have an object (objectA) and want to generate a new object (objectB) that
will have the top half of objectA intact plus the bottom of objectA
intersected with a cylinder.

So far I have this:
union() {
    intersection() {
        sphere(r=10);
        translate([0, 0, 11])
            cube(size=22, center=true);
    }
    intersection() {
        sphere(r=10);
        translate([0, 0, - 6 + 0.1]) // adding 0.1 just to make sure they
overlap
            cylinder(r=5, h=12, center=true);
    }
}

Is there a better way of doing it?
The object is not a sphere, but it gives the idea.

why did you change the sphere to a cube in the 2nd intersection?

In the sample code the objectA IS the sphere.
In my local copy the calls to both spheres will be replaced by calls to a
module that generates the desired object.

Maybe this clear things up.
union() {
    intersection() {
        objectA();
        translate([0, 0, 11])
            cube(size=22, center=true);
    }
    intersection() {
        objectA();
        translate([0, 0, - 6 + 0.1]) // adding 0.1 just to make sure they
overlap
            cylinder(r=5, h=12, center=true);
    }
}

module objectA() {
    sphere(r=10);
}

Any time you have the choice between a cube and anything more complex for masking operations, go with the cube for performance.

Well that was what you had. I assumed you were not happy with what you had.
Uf your original is correct then that is how to do it.
I assumed you were not happy with the latter bit, where the sphere caused
the curved bottom.

If you have a basic example you are happy with why ask for improvements. Set
theory of objects is really basic.

not necessarily better, but with OpenSCAD you could also have the module give
the transformation instead of the object:

module mytransformation()
{
	intersection() {
		children(0);
		translate([0, 0, 11]) cube(size=22, center=true);
	}
	intersection() {
		translate([0, 0, - 6 + 0.1]) cylinder(r=5, h=12, center=true);  // adding
0.1 just to make sure they overlap
		children(0);
	}   
}


mytransformation() sphere(10);

I don't want to incorrectly name my shapes.

Is the result of resizing a circle like

resize([100,50]) circle(10);

technically, an ellipse?

If you make an ellipse into 3D for example

hull() {
    resize([100,50]) cylinder(r=10,h=0.1);	
    translate([0,0,10]) 
        scale([0.8,0.8,1])  // tapered
        resize([100,50]) cylinder(r=10,h=0.1);
}

What is the right Mathematical name for such a shape?

An  elipse <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse>   is an oval, but an  oval
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval>   is not an elipse.

linear_extrude(height = 10, center = true, convexity = 10, twist = 0, slices
= 20, scale = .8) {
	scale([1, 0.5]) circle(r=50);
}

would be in theory more correct, but I can imagine that in practice the hull
solution works better.

Thanks!

Do you build your own OpenSCAD? If so, could you try the latest master? I fixed some STL export issues, as well as added a manifold sanity check which will report non-manifold results. With the master, this design exports a clean STL.

We?ll push another development snapshot shortly.

No, I'll test when a new snapshot comes out.

BTW it was reasonable easy to fix in the scad source. Usual suspects.

Mr. Summers:
    Most 3D printer tool chains understand STL files.
Export the file as STL from OpenSCAD and then
use the tool chain from your printer to translate it into G-code.

the nightly that arrived today seems to be clean, and i don't see these

Would it be difficult to allow import() of STEP files?

Can anyone recommend a converter to STL?

FreeCAD (http://freecadweb.org/) can read STEP files and export to STL.
One can also script it to do batch conversion.

Probably yes, STEP is a huge beast. The way to go would likely be to integrate
the lib from http://stepcode.org/ - I did not dig deep enough to have a feeling
how much effort it would be to get at least some core features that allow to
read a reasonable amount of files.

actually, i'm going in the reverse direction.

my mold maker said "we normally receive STEP files, please send us 
those".  does anyone know of a way to convert STL to STEP?

is there any kind of open source 3d modeler (a la openSCAD) that uses 
STEP files?

any information would be appreciated.  tia!

Hi,

FreeCAD (http://freecadweb.org/) can also output step files (and read
the CSG files exported by OpenSCAD, which allows to convert from
OpenSCAD to STEP or IGES or many other formats).

Greetings

Note you only need two rotations to point a cylinder to a point. So just
rotx and rotz should do it but you need to do them in the right order.

A much simpler way is to place spheres at your two points and take the hull
to make a cylinder that joins them with nice rounded joints.

Hi,

depending on what you want to do there is a very easy (but somewhat slow)
way to do this in OpenSCAD.
Its called chain-hull. Just dont set $fn to a very high number. This will
make nice transitions between the tubes.

r=.5;

fn_sphere=16;

// I have a massive of points, like this:

POINTS =

[[20.000000,5.000000,15.000000],[20.000000,5.000000,25.000000],[25.000000,0.000000,15.000000],[25.000000,0.000000,25.000000],[25.000000,15.000000,-15.000000],[-15.000000,15.000000,-15.000000],[25.000000,15.000000,-25.000000],[0.000000,15.000000,-25.000000],[25.000000,25.000000,25.000000]];


for(i=[0:len(POINTS)-1]){

hull(){

translate(POINTS[i])sphere(r,$fn=fn_sphere);

translate(POINTS[i+1])sphere(r,$fn=fn_sphere);

}

}

@nop head: smile

But your problem would be a good one for an example in MCAD.
These 3d rotations are tricky, (use of tan2)

Unfortunately, that's more of synthetic problem, which states that those
should be cylinders; I tried to replace the spheres in your example with
circles, but obviously circles are being created towards [0,0,1], which
makes hulls that aren't towards [0,0,1] not cylinders. Making hulls is very
good method, which I couldn't think of, but still requires those rotations
to be calculated properly.

You can use cylinders with height epsilon=.001 and hull them together.
But, yes, you need to get the rotations correct, first.

I can generate the nc code without a problem. I want to then use openSCAD
to verify the code cuts the part correct.
I will need to set up openSCAD with a set of matrices to simulate the
machine motion and position the tool.
Create/import geometry to simulate material to be cut.
Define geometry to use for the tool.
Use the nc code positions to simulate cutting the part.

But, yes, you need to get the rotations correct, first.

The problem is that I'm not any good at maths and tried to "calibrate" those
angles with some obvious example, like [[25,25,25],[0,0,0]], which brought
me nowhere.
So I thought that someone has the working solution for such problem.

Here's a simple module that I use in my work and an example of how to 
use it to move/size the cylinders. This also should be much faster than 
using hull().

You could easily modify this to make a single module that would take two 
points as well...

moduleaimAt(p) {
     rotate([0,0, atan2(p.y,p.x)])
         rotate([0, atan2(norm([p.x,p.y]), p.z),0])
         children();
}

// First Point
a=[20,5,10];

// Second Point
b=[100,10,30];

// Point Markers
translate(a) color("red")sphere(r=1);
translate(b) color("green")sphere(r=1);

// Starting at a, aim towards b. Cylinder length is the magnitude of b-a
translate(a) aimAt(b-a)cylinder(r=.5,h=norm(b-a));

The result should look like this:

Here is some old code of mine (from the file attached)


// place the extruded shape at the position x(t) and

// rotate it so that is normal to thepath

module place(t){

translate(x(t))

rotate([0,0,a1(t)])

rotate([0,90-a2(t),0])

rotate([0,0,twist(t)])

scale(s(t))

child();

}


// distance between points x(t) and x(t+dt) projected onto the xy-plane

function dxy(t)=sqrt(

pow(x(t+dt)[0]-x(t)[0],2)+

pow(x(t+dt)[1]-x(t)[1],2)

);


// angle between x-axis and projection of dx(t) onto the xy-plane

function a1(t)=atan2(x(t+dt)[1]-x(t)[1],x(t+dt)[0]-x(t)[0]);


// angle between xy plane and dx(t) vector

function a2(t)=atan2(x(t+dt)[2]-x(t)[2],dxy(t));

The following code should do what you want. The connectPoints module generates a cylinder centred at the midpoint of p1 and p2, rotated
appropriately to face the two points:

module connectPoints(p1,p2,RADIUS){
  translate((p1+p2)/2)
    rotate([-acos((p2[2]-p1[2]) / norm(p1-p2)),0,
            -atan2(p2[0]-p1[0],p2[1]-p1[1])])
       cylinder(r=RADIUS, h=norm(p1-p2), center = true, $fn=12);
}

POINTS =
[[20.000000,5.000000,15.000000],[20.000000,5.000000,25.000000],[25.000000,0.000000,15.000000],[25.000000,0.000000,25.000000],[25.000000,15.000000,-15.000000],[-15.000000,15.000000,-15.000000],[25.000000,15.000000,-25.000000],[0.000000,15.000000,-25.000000],[25.000000,25.000000,25.000000]];

for(i = [0:len(POINTS)-2]){
	connectPoints(POINTS[i],POINTS[i+1],1);
}

I use this to generate connections between bases on DNA models. The code for doing the rotation was picked up somewhere from the web, but I
can't recall where -- it's a somewhat common problem.

Big thanks for all the guys ! Hypher's code worked awesome, topic can be
closed!
Sorry for "small talk", just I don't know how to close thread another way :)
Love!

Subject: [OpenSCAD] hull to create elbow not working
Message-ID: <54E61782.8070109@dbtgroup.com>

hi everybody,

i'm trying to use a hull() to create an elbow:

hull()
     translate([0, -12.5, 4])	// vertical part
         cylinder(r=1.5, h=20, $fn=30);
     rotate([90, 0, 45])		// horizontal part
         translate([-8.9, 5.4, 8])
             cylinder(r=1.5, h=20, $fn=30);

this isn't working.  the two cylinders intersect in a 90deg angle with 
no smoothing or curving where they meet.

these two cylinders "route" a wire that needs to be fed.  i need the 
elbow because when the wire hits the end of the horizontal part, it 
refuses to go up into the vertical part and simply bends.  i'm thinking 
that the elbow will ensure the wire transitions (smoothly or otherwise) 
from horizontal to vertical.

anybody have any ideas?  i googled "elbow scad", and found lots of 
examples, but not any scad source.

thanks in advance for any feedback!
yvette

If the missing curly braces aren't just a typo and what you're looking for is
more of a fillet type of operator, have a look at this example I came up
with a while back:

I didn't look closely at the rotation and translation code, but I 
suspected that there was something wrong with that part, not the actual 
bending part.

When removing that code (which could easily be added back in to the 
entire object), things line up correctly:

R=5;
rc=1.5;

detail=30;

translate([0,0,R+rc])// vertical part
     cylinder(r=rc, h=20, $fn=detail);

translate([0,-R,rc])
     rotate([90,0,0])
     cylinder(r=rc, h=20, $fn=detail);

modulebent(){
     translate([0,0,R+rc])
     rotate([0,90,0])
     translate([0,-R,0])
     difference(){
         rotate_extrude($fn=60,convexity=4)
         translate([R,0])rotate([0,0,360/detail/2])circle(rc,$fn=detail);
         translate([0,-2*R,0])cube(4*R,true);
         translate([-2*R,0,0])cube(4*R,true);
     }
}

Subject: [OpenSCAD] 5 axis tool path
Message-ID: <CAHF93hTQ1ZPicBcOVELnrAvhJjpEij9YCwqfTyQWGc8PgxLrxQ@mail.gmail.com>

Gentlemen,
This is my first 'successful' attempt to generate a 5 axis cut in OpenSCAD.
If you subtract this from a block or imported stl file you would have
rudimentary gcode cutter verification operation.
I realise this rendering is not perfect as the facits do not look like I
think they should be accurately simulate a 5 axis path. The sides, top and
bottom would be ruled surfaces from edge to edge but this should do pretty
good as most 5 axis tool path is made up of very short point,vector to
point,vector motion.
Here goes - critique or improvement is very much appreciated

// 1 inch cutter with 1/8 corner radius

// a bullnose cutter

// to simulate a 5 axis cut difference a block

// and this path - not perfect but a good start

cornerrad = .125;

tooldia=1;

toollength=2;

smooth = 3; // Number of facets of rounding cylinder


$fn=smooth;


translate([0,0,0]) {

hull() {

translate([0,0,0])

{

rotate([0,0,0])

{

rotate_extrude(convexity=10,$fn=smooth*5)

translate([tooldia/2-cornerrad,cornerrad,0])

circle(cornerrad);


 translate([0,0,cornerrad])

cylinder(toollength,tooldia/2,tooldia/2,$fn=smooth*5);


 translate([0,0,0])

cylinder(toollength/4,tooldia/2-cornerrad,tooldia/2-cornerrad);

}

}


translate([0,10,0])

{

rotate([0,10,0])

{

rotate_extrude(convexity=10,$fn=smooth*5)

translate([tooldia/2-cornerrad,cornerrad,0])

circle(cornerrad);


 translate([0,0,cornerrad])

cylinder(toollength,tooldia/2,tooldia/2,$fn=smooth*5);


 translate([0,0,0])

cylinder(toollength/4,tooldia/2-cornerrad,tooldia/2-cornerrad);

}

}

}

}

thanks
Stuart

Subject: [OpenSCAD] questions on rotate_extrude
Message-ID: <1424434173979-11674.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi, this is my first post. My name is Carsten Arnholm. My background is among
other things C++ programming using geometry kernels like ACIS. So I have
some understanding of the basics of boolean operations, although it is some
years back.

I am learning OpenSCAD now and find it a fantastic tool. Well done,
congratulations! 

I have read some tutorials, watched YouTube videos and now I am trying to
make my first design using one of the latest snapshot releases of OpenSCAD.

This is my result so far
http://arnholm.org/tmp/openscad/mold_attempt1.png

Made with this code
http://arnholm.org/tmp/openscad/mold_attempt1.scad
(suggested improvements very welcome!)


I have 2 basic questions/comments

1. rotate_extrude
-------------------
The rotate_extrude command seems broken

a) The rotation axis is unspecified, from drawings only you can infer it to
be z-axis

b) if you assume rotation axis is z-axis and then rotate the profile into
x-z plane, the extrusion fails to give a meaningful result (only a planar
disc). By guessing that The extrusion contained an implicit/undocumented
rotation into X-z plane, I was able to obtain the result I was looking for.
But this is not correct behaviour I think.

c) There is no way to rotate anything less than 360 degrees. A major
limitation. You have to make a full rotation and then cut away the rest
later using difference(), which is not optimal.

2. Tongue/groove
--------------------
The part shown is supposed to be a 10 degree "cake slice". By printing 36
copies on a 3d printer you would get a full 360 degree mold by gluing them
together. To make it strong it would be most useful to include a
tongue/groove connection (groove on one side of the part, tongue on the
other). However, I really don't see yet how to do that with OpenSCAD. Any
suggestions?

Please understand that I am really enthusiastic about OpenSCAD and don't
mean to be critical, basically trying to learn.

	Server 2012
Message-ID: <1424456051902-11678.post@n5.nabble.com>

I've been trying to run openscad export png function on an azure windows
Server Virtual machine. The problem is that azure virtual machines have very
basic openGL support so I tried using Mesa as explained on the last lines 
here
<http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Building_on_Microsoft_Windows>  

After running $ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-mesa on MSYS2 I tried both
copying opengl32.dll to System32 and and copying it to the same folder as
openscad.exe but keep getting the same as error as before when running png
export:

Framebuffer Object extension not found by GLEW. 
Can't create OpenGL OffscreenView. Code: -1.

How could I run openscad on top of Mesa?

@Andrew: Thank you, that is good to know, I can imagine it is a frequent
request.

I didn't see how to proceed with attempt1, so I tried again in a different
way. The first attempt appeared to show it was difficult to describe the
concave corner blend (therefore I faked it). That means the model wasn't
really parametric anymore anyway. So instead I redesigned the 2D profile in 
LibreCAD <http://librecad.org>   and then imported that it into OpenSCAD via
DXF (R12). This seems to be easier (I didn't know LibreCAD either).

>From LibreCAD
Basic profile: http://arnholm.org/tmp/openscad/mold_profile_R12.dxf
With "tongue": http://arnholm.org/tmp/openscad/mold_tongue_R12.dxf

With that I was able to proceed in OpenSCAD
http://arnholm.org/tmp/openscad/mold_attempt2.scad
http://arnholm.org/tmp/openscad/g3d.scad

The files show how I worked around the missing angle parameter in
rotate_extrude. It kind of worked, but a proper implementation in OpenSCAD
is clearly to be preferred.

A couple if images of the result
http://arnholm.org/tmp/openscad/mold_attempt2_2.png
http://arnholm.org/tmp/openscad/mold_attempt2_stlC.png
This is clearly closer to the original design idea.

I could not find anything like that on Thingiverse (which does not mean it
does not exist...).

I would strongly recommend running on a Linux VM instead, as the chance of getting community help would be a lot higher.
However, if you do figure this out, it would be very appreciated if you could update the documentation, or post an email to the list with your experiences.

..and there?s always the option of going to the source: Ask Azure customer support for OpenGL 2 support.

Cheers,

 -Marius

Another aspect of the camera needing to be closer is you are far more
likely to have negative objects hit the front clipping plane and being
ignored.

Can you open the GUI at all? If yes, can you please post the

This would include the OpenGL driver the GUI application found.

Are you running the 64bit OpenSCAD binary?

Subject: [OpenSCAD] OpenSCAD 2015.02 Release Candidate 3
Message-ID: <1D332A44-F72B-426C-BC05-5084B0E81A3F@kintel.net>

Hi all,

Thanks for testing out first two Release Candidates. We?ve some remaining issues (see below).

Please consider the current master branch and snapshot binaries >= 2015.02.20 the third Release Candidate of OpenSCAD 2015.02. 

As usual, we?re planning to give it a week or so for testing before making a release, unless significant enough bugs or regressions surface, in which case the whole process will have to rinse and repeat until we?re content. 

Please give it a spin and pour your complaints here or on the github issue tracker. 
This is most likely the last attempt before making it a proper release.

Thanks, 

-Marius

With 2015.02.20, I get degenerated faces with the above code. But no holes.

But the exported stl passes Netfabb tests.

Degenerate faces are normal - we haven?t attempted to fix this yet. One good fix for such issues is to flip edges. This is possible in MeshLab.
I don?t believe this should affect any real use of the design.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] hull()
Message-ID: <1970973697.2576003.1424592122361.JavaMail.yahoo@mail.yahoo.com>

couple of weeks ago accidentaly deleted most of my work.
Before I did find a neat way to round edges using hull(), rather than minkowski which is kinda too slow for my taste, I tried to replicate from memory the code but no luck,
it was something like:
?
//**** HandlerBar module ******

idiameter = 32.5;
band_dickness = 3;
band_width = 20;
xdiameter = idiameter + band_dickness;

fix_block_high = 15;
stop = 2;
sideWall = 2 *2;

//**** Flash light Module *****

detach_lower_block_length = fix_block_length - stop;
detach_lower_block_width = band_width - sideWall;
detach_lower_block_high = 3;
chanel_width = 3;
chanel_neck = 3;
detach_upper_block_length = 35;
detach_upper_block_width = 25;
detach_upper_block_high = 15;
roundRadio = 1;

screw_offset_length = 8 * 2; //two per side
screw_offset_width = band_width;
screw_offset_dickness = 3 * 2;? //uper & lower sides


//union()
//??? {
??? hull()
??? ??? {
??? ??? for(i=[0:3])

??? ??? translate(-[i % 2] * band_width, + i[i % 2] * xdiameter + screw_offset_length, 0], cube(), center = true);??? //I get a syntax error on this line, why?
??? ??? }
//***** ??? ??? 
?
?I found this other one with two for()s, the problem is does not round the top of cube edges:
?
?hull(){

??? for(end = [-1,1])
??? for(side = [-1,1])
??? translate([end * (length / 2 - orad), side * (width / 2 - orad), 0])
??? ??? {
??? cylinder(r = orad, h = height);
??? sphere(orad);
??? ??? }
??? }

I will appreciate any help.

Your brackets () and [] are all mixed up:

//union()

// {

hull()

{

for(i=[0:3])


 translate([-(i % 2) * band_width, + i*(i % 2) * xdiameter +

Still mixed up :)
But I did only fixed syntax, not sure it does what you need:

value=1;

//union()

// {

hull()

{

for(i=[0:3])


 translate([-(i % 2) * band_width, + i*(i % 2) * xdiameter +
screw_offset_length, 0]) cube(value, center = true); //I get a syntax error

That's currently not possible with OpenSCAD, there is no color/
texture support for the final model (the preview does support
color).
A possible way is to export the model as STL and import into
Blender. There you have lots of options to finish the appearance
of the model and also generate high quality renderings.

In case you did not use Blender before, have a look at
Andrew Price: https://www.youtube.com/user/AndrewPPrice
Sardi Pax: https://www.youtube.com/user/srf123

Part 2 of "How to make an Airplane" tutorial has some good
examples of how to apply textures to a model:

Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu9J0D6ebVw
Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4lsgMw9uQc

I'm not too familiar with those tools. Have your tried asking Autodesk

If you find anything, it would be appreciated if you could share your

In OpenSCAD you'll have to do it the old fashioned way:

for (i=[0:10])

for (j=[0:10])

translate([i*1.1+j/2,j*1.1,0])cube();

?

I had a chance to give it a quick spin on Mac. The few issues I encountered
in the order from 'limits usability' to 'don't care':

* Double clicking on a part of an object no longer centers the view on that
point.
* Scale markers below 1 mm have floating point rounding issues. See:
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n11697/markers.png> 
* Icons look like crap on high resolution (Retina) displays:

Hi Oskar,

Thanks for testing!

When did this last work? I?ve never used this feature and I cannot find any version of OpenSCAD where it works as you describe..

Fixed in master.

I know. Look at the built-in Qt (X) icon below, which is equally crappy. This is a long-standing Qt issue.
The fix will most probably be to draw the icons in SVG and hook them into Qt that way. Would probably require Qt 5.4.x.
It?s out of scope for the upcoming release, but will be handled shortly after.

Maybe the scale markers would be easier to read, when the underscore used
for a dot would be replaced by small square.

When did this last work? I?ve never used this feature and I cannot find any

It has worked (for me) since #865 was merged. I have no idea when the
regression occurred.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] cylinder radius problem
Message-ID: <1424632620588-11703.post@n5.nabble.com>

I am designing a part where I need recesses for nuts.  
So I put in a pair of differences as follows:

	// Recesses for nuts
  translate ([Screw1_X,0,Nut_Offset]) cylinder (r = Nut_Rad,
h=Nut_High,center = false, $fn=6);
  translate ([Screw2_X,0,Nut_Offset]) cylinder (r = Nut_Rad,
h=Nut_High,center = false, $fn=6);

Nut_Rad is defined as 4.5

The actual part is measuring 6.93mm across the flats and 7mm at the corners. 
My outer dims on the part are perfect, the printer is calibrated. 

So how do I get these recesses to be 9mm across the flats?

i'm confused as to what you want.

if you want a "nut capture" recess, where it prevents the nut from 
turning, then the $fn=6 "cylinder" should have a radius of 3.5, as you 
mentioned it's "measuring 6.93mm across the flats".  if you get a 
perfect print, it would fit.

however, the actual size of the nut capture depends upon your printer 
settings.  i've had to add between 0.25mm and 0.5mm (typically) to get 
stuff to "fit right".

but what is really confusing is that you have a hex nut that's 6.93mm 
across the flats and "7mm at the corners".  that's pretty round, imo.

are you sure you measured your hex nut correctly?

i have a 6/32 (hex) nut i measured.  it's 8mm across the flats, and 9mm 
across the corners.

Divide the a/f radius by cos(30) to get the a/c radius, which is what
cylinder takes.

When you make a hexagon, the radius is the distance from the center to the corners. To get a hexagon with a specified dimension from the center to the flats (called the apothem), divide your radius by cos(180/6). This works for other polygons too if you change the 6 to whatever $fn value you're using. To get the nut to fit, you'll probably need to add a bit of tolerance as well.

That was measuring the printed cavity.

The actual part measures 8.48 on the flats and 9.59 on the corners.  8/32

So my confusion is that I thought a six sided cylinder of radius 4.5 would
be 9mm diameter either on the flats or across the corners, but it's small
on both.

Did you measure it in software to make sure it is the size you think it is, or just in the print? Your printer may not be as finely calibrated as you think it is.

Netfabb basic has a measuring tool that works for this, or you can just place a cube in openscad with the background modifier to compare.

The outer dims of the part are 25 x 70 and I measure 25.12 x 70.30   With a
little surface roughness on the edges, that's about perfect.

My holes for the screws are what they should be, the screws are barely
scraping as designed.

I suspect there's something I don't know about how cylinders work with low
side counts.

A 3D printed part will always be smaller across corners than the STL file
it is printed from because you get a radiused corner rather than an
infinitely sharp one. The corner radius depends on the filament width and
how much the plastic is stretched.

By a/c I assume you mean "Across the Corners".

The thing is, with specifying 4.5 I should have had 9mm across the corners,
and it's not even close.

Yes a/c is across corners. But as I stated above it will always be too small
unless you use an infinitely thin filament to get a sharp corner and measure
it with an infinitely thin calliper.

The a/f measurement should be correct if you set the radius to it divided by
cos(30) if you printer is correctly calibrated.

Also note that a real nut is also smaller across corners because it too
doesn't have infinitely sharp edges.

Understood, but the flats are WAY small.

So on the physical nut, I measure 8.5mm across the flats.
Radius is then 4.25
Cos(30) is 0.866 so I would get  4.9

Ok, I'll give that a try.

Can I use the cosine function in OpenScad?

Yes it is cos(30) in OpenScad.

Ok, here's what I ended up with:

Nut_Flats = 8.50; // Measure across the flats.

Nut_Slack = 0.2;

Flats_Rad = Nut_Flats/2;

Nut_Rad = ((Flats_Rad / cos(30)) + Nut_Slack); // Correction factor to
allow a little wiggle.

Cool. Layer 1 is down, and a real nut sits nicely in the recess.

Thanks folks!  

I'm liking this program a lot.  I've use PovRay for years for modeling light
pipes and such, and this is very similar.

Not bricks, but you may get some ideas from  this
<http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5299>   or  this
<http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:31832>  .

You could think about using surface() to provide a brick texture (is a 3D
sense) , should be easy to script a repetitive pattern.

I still cannot reproduce this; tested on Mac and Win 7, but I don't have
access to a 64-bit Win 7..
Could you put the STL of the broken stripped code somewhere?

Not entirely true. You can import a DXF of the brick pattern and then
extrude it and difference it.

However, a word of caution. The difference between the surface of a brick
and the mortar is usually of the order of millimetres, it's almost always
the case that a correct scale down of bricks to a 3D printed model should
not have brick patterns scribed into it and you can do the brick patterns
far more accurately when colouring it (eg using vinyls).

..of course there is the option to use surface(?texture.png?).
This will create some sort of relief, assuming that intensities in the png are representative of elevation values.
Then, the resulting object can be treated like any other object in OpenSCAD.

Note: This will likely severely impact your rendering (F6) performance.

That STL is fine.
It looks like you have a broken MeshLab.
I've tested it in meshlab, admesh as well as reading it back to OpenSCAD
itself. It all works.

Right, I think I see the problem.
In the STL:
  facet normal nan nan nan

MeshLab under Windows might not like that.
I'll look into it.

You can use "include<file.scad>". If you have data on your own format, you
can write an external script to reformat that data as valid openscad data
(e.g. arrays) which can be included.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] How to get at individual children?
Message-ID: <1424732541176-11738.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hello. I'm trying to write a module that will perform an operation on subsets
of its children. I tried using children() with an index, but this still
seems to give me all of the children. I'm seeing this behavior both with
2013.01+dfsg-2.2 (the latest binary in the Ubuntu 14.04 repo) and a build I
did myself from git commit 0dd3f004dd66798faef42ab4edaa72c12dc0ad66.

Here's a simplified version of what I'm trying that illustrates the problem:

    module first() {
        child(0);
    }

    first() {
        for(i=[0:20:120]) {
            rotate([0,0,i]) translate([10,0,0]) cylinder();
        }
    }

The for loop generates 7 cylinders in an arc. I would expect the "first"
module to then ignore all of them except the first, so I expect to see only
one cylinder. Instead I see all 7.

I have tried using children() instead of child() and I have also tried using
index=0 instead of just 0 as the parameter. Either way, the result is the
same (except some don't compile on the older OpenSCAD binary).

Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?

You ar enot doing anything wrong, there is an implicit union()
happening after for().

The problem is for always unions it children so there is only ever one
child of first() and that is the for() node.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Retain aspect ratio when using scale() or resize()?
Message-ID: <1424789834315-11744.post@n5.nabble.com>

Is there an undocumented parameter to either of these transformation
functions that allows me to retain the aspect ratio of the child node?

Example: if I use surface() to create a texture map from a PNG, is there a
way to resize the output to fit within a specified boundary without
affecting the aspect ratio?

No, but resize() has a documented parameter :-))

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Transformations#resize

"If the 'auto' parameter is set to true, it will auto-scale any 0-dimensions to match."

That only catches the case where you know which of the dimension is
the leading one. So what's not working (as far as I know) is to say:

"fit into a cuboid of size xyz and scale such that it maximizes the volume inside"

Scale() can't have a separate parameter as it has factors as values, so
if it should retain aspect ratio, it simply needs the same value.

ciao,
  Torsten.

In a simple single file project I have no syntax error highlighting with
either editor. Has this been removed?

Also the font size seems to be much bigger in the Syntilla editor. Does the
simple editor not use the settings in the preferences?

No, says math: either aspect ratio and a 1-dim boundary, or two-dim
boundary.

Ah, I see. Thanks.

Is there any workaround for this behavior? I tried rebuilding OpenSCAD in
the issue350 branch and running it with the  --enable=lazy-union flag, but
it still gives me 7 cylinders.

No because children are not individual 3D objects, They are child nodes in
the syntax tree.

E.g.

child(1) {
  a();
  b();
  c();
}

will select b(), which could generate many objects.

Yes, get that that's the behavior of for, though I honestly don't see how
the implicit union is desirable, except for backward compatibility.

What I'm asking is: how can I create a sequence of 3D objects in a loop,
and then iterate through them individually in a separate module? For
example, is there a way to get at the individual children of a union?

Here's a more concrete example of what I'd like to be able to do:

    module hull_join() {
        union() {
            for_without_a_union (i=[0:$children - 2]) {
                hull() {
                    children(index=i);
                    children(index=i+1);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    hull_join() {
        for_without_a_union(i=[0:20:120]) {
            rotate([0,0,i]) translate([10,0,0]) cylinder();
        }
    }

If for_without_a_union existed, then this would create a set of cylinders
in an arc and then hull_join would union together the hulls of each
adjacent pair producing a round arc path. See this combined screenshot:
https://imgur.com/MJjDlcY

To generate the left half of that screenshot I ended up manually unrolling
the loop, but I'm hoping there's a way to use/implement hull_join that
doesn't require unrolling loops, inlining the caller, or other sorts of
special-casing.

Have you considered recursion? (I haven't for your particular issue, brain
not awake yet)

That's an interesting idea!

I just tried this...

    module segment(i, step, last) {
        rotate([0,0,i]) translate([10,0,0]) cylinder();
        if (i < last) segment(i + step, step, last);
    }

    hull_join() {
        segment(0, 20, 120);
    }

... and I still end up with something that looks a like the right image.

Something still seems to be making an implicit union. Is there some other
approach that could avoid this?

This doesn't work with arbitrary 3D objects, but will do what you want from one
child and a series of transformations:

-------------
use <scad-utils/transformations.scad>

module hull_join (transformations)
{
    for (i = [0 : len (transformations) - 2])
    hull () {
        multmatrix (transformations[i])
        children ();

        multmatrix (transformations[i + 1])
        children ();
    }
}

hull_join ([
        for (i = [0 : 20 : 120])
        rotation ([0, 0, i]) *
        translation ([10, 0, 0])
])
cylinder (d = 1, h = 20);
-------------

One of the reasons why #350 isn?t merged yet is because we haven?t resolved this properly.
There?s a suggestion to make such unpacking of nodes explicit:

Suggestions are welcome.

Thanks for your reply. The auto parameter works as long as the imported PNG
is in a known orientation as you say, but I was hoping I could do something
for a totally generic solution. 

Am I correct that there are no functions that can return the dimensions of
an imported PNG file?

It feels like resize() should be extended to have options for specifying a maximum bounding box and preserve aspect ratio.

auto reload from an external editor.

Thx.
This behavior is due to the fix for https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/406
It?s still unknown why that didn?t work. Could be an issue with Qt.
I don?t dare to touch this unless I can make sure #406 doesn?t resurface.

It isn't a big problem now I discovered I can just press F5 to see the
error.

And maybe also have some kind of position() thingy too to go along with that? I guess both together should cover most use-cases to fit unknown/extern model parts into some scad design (e.g. STL, DXF, text(), ...).

That takes an unduly long time to F5 for me, 23s.

Yes, unfortunately, the implicit union strikes back.
Using the issue350 branch, it?s down to < 1 second.
Unrolling the loop is a good workaround for now.

As Marius mentioned, it's the for() that's causing the performance hit.
Unrolling the loop will make it render instantly:

hull() {
     translate(30*[0,0,0]) sphere(10);
     translate(30*[0,0,1]) sphere(10);
     translate(30*[0,1,0]) sphere(10);
     translate(30*[0,1,1]) sphere(10);
     translate(30*[1,0,0]) sphere(10);
     translate(30*[1,0,1]) sphere(10);
     translate(30*[1,1,0]) sphere(10);
     translate(30*[1,1,1]) sphere(10);
}

It was working OK for me, but JIC I checked .25 anyway with the OP .scad
file, and it still works OK.
shadowwynd will need to confirm in his environment. (assuming he gets
notified as he was/is not registered properly)

I just tested it.  It has worked OK on every file I have tried.  
The STL files are even a little smaller, which is good too.

I am on the mailing list again.


Thank you so much for all the work you have put into this program.

I'm surprised this doesn't exist - it would seem a fundamental requirement to
be able to annotate what is often a technical drawing.

I assume annotate() would mean it doesn't end up in a 3D print. How would
this be managed? Is the annotation a 3D or a 2D object?

Did this ever get raised on github, I couldn't find it?

I don't think there's a github issue yet. Also that issue would be much more
useful if questions like the one above had already an answer or suggestion
how to handle it.

The example image might be a good starting point for finding a way how to
specify the information to get that model including the annotations.

ciao,

One key part of this feature could be that, if this doesn?t make it past preview, we have some freedom in terms of how to render it, meaning we don?t have to be pixel-perfect from version to version. That might help in terms of how we implement it.

Message-ID: <1424965769321-11784.post@n5.nabble.com>

I'm a OpenSCAD noob (just a few hours usage), so not best qualified to offer
a solution. 

Still, I have some thoughts...

The annotation needs to be kept separate from the main model, since you need
to be able to export a model without annotations. 

The example code by Scalpel78 

  annotate("M4 nut pocket") cube([3,3,3]); 

appears to show the annotation attached to an object. My suggestion is that
it would be attached to a point in space, which i'll call the "point of
interest".

How to render the text...

The simplest code I could think of to provide an annotation is:

  annotate("M4 bolt", [12, 13, 15]);      //12,13,15 is the annotation's
point of interest

This code allows for different ways of rendering the annotation

Option1)  All annotations are always shown in the same 2D plane as the
user's screen (the viewport?) The problem is that annotations from different
parts of the model will soon clutter the screen. The position in the 2D
viewport would be automatic.

Option2) Each annotation has it's own 3D point position, defaulting to
[0,0,0], but the orientation is always in the same plane as the 2D viewport.
All annotations would need to add a translate().

  translate([2, 3, 4]) annotate("M4 bolt", [12, 13, 15]);

Option2b) Alternate method signature, with the translate built in.

  annotate("M4 bolt", [12, 13, 15], [2, 3, 4]);

Option3) It could be a fully 3D object - like a cube with text on one
surface. The problem here is that as you view the model from different
angles, the text will disappear when viewed "end on" (though this could be
an advantage for some models if the annotation were orientated sensibly).
The cube size is automatic, based on the text size. Translate and/or rotate
allows us to position it like any other object.

  rotate([0,180,0]) translate([2, 3, 4]) annotate("M4 bolt", [12, 13, 15]);

Once the method signature is decided, it could even be an option in OpenSCAD
to decide how to render the annotations. (stay flat to the viewport, or
rotate with the model)

If font size and text colour options are required, the method signature
would be more complex.

My favourite is probably Option2, but opinions will likely differ.

I'm sure there are some experts who can help explore all these options
better than I can.

You really dont want to do that, the last thing you want to be doing is to
have to rebuild all your annotations because you changed the size of a
dimension on some component, annotations definatly need to be anchored to
nodes in the model, after all that is what they reffer to, not some
arbitary point in space. However rendering need to be smart, and needs to
adapt to the position of the viewport etc. If you export to a medium that
does not support annotations, then by all means suppress them, but if the
medium supports them they should stay with the model.

A hide/show annotations would definatly be usefull.

Tim,

yes you're absolutely right. I really didn't think that through. Annotations
should be attached to the object not a point in space, which takes us
straight back to Scalpel78's original suggestion of:

  annotate("M4 nut pocket") cube([3,3,3]); 

My 3 suggestions about how to render are still appropriate:
text rendered in 2D on the viewport plane, rendered at a 3D location but
with 2D rendering of text on the viewport plane, or a full 3D object where
the text rotates with the model.
