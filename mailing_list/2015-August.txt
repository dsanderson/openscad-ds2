Wow!  I had no idea you could do what you did, so this is very important 
to me!  Not sure I have as much patience as you did.  How long do you 
think it would take you to  make the anvil if you were not documenting 
the process along the way?

Message-ID: <1438433507490-13392.post@n5.nabble.com>

Test example from RepRapPro

- rendered in color
- output to 3 STL files, one for each color

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13392/screen4.png> 

If you want to try this build you will need to build from source
https://github.com/bobc/openscad/tree/carve_csg. I have only built linux
version so far, I will look at building a windows version later. Bear in
mind this is work in progress, not even really an alpha version.

Several things have been lost in the Carve implementation, notably 3D hull
and minkowski, as well as output to OFF, PLY. Other things that depend on
unique features of CGAL will have stopped working too. The triangulation is
buggy too, I need to implement a better triangulator.

Jon,
It would take maybe an hour.  I already have the hull_shape and pointer
modules written.  I use hull_shape a lot when I have an STL to use for a
frame work.  When you can find the limits of an arbitrary shape with the 
pointer, then the hull_shape makes it easy.

And it is easy to union separate sections together.  I didn't have a spot to
show this with the anvil, but you can use the same locations for the joining
part (a plane typically) for two hull_shapes and use spheres of slightly
different sizes.  The join will be manifold.


Steve

Well nothing happens.

Before I loaded any 3Dc software OpenSCAD 2015.06.20 both 32 & 64 bit do not
respond to the SpaceMouse (SM) Wireless. The SM was in Device Manager,
confirmed with the HID/VID/PID  "USB\VID_256F&PID_C62F\...", as the default
M/S HID Complient Device driver.

The SM works with the demo/test programs with 3Dconnexions (3Dc) drivers
loaded.

With the 3Dc driver started, OpenSCAD zooms in/out using the for/backward
tilt, presumably responding to scroll wheel emulation, when the 3Dc drivers
are stopped it does not respond to the SM.

To double check I later uninstalled the 3Dc HID driver in Device Manager, it
reinstalled as the Microsoft HID Complient Device. Still no response in
OpenSCAD.

The help/Library Info shows InputDrivers: HidApiInputDriver so it is the
right version, I presume.

Suggestions?

I noticed the following text in your instructable:

"One should not expect to do many things one would do with most programming languages. Unfortunately, it was a little too limited, the
recent addition of list comprehensions has been a huge addition to OpenSCAD."

I beg to differ. It just takes a bit of brain twisting to get the hang of functional languages and recursive list structures:

http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:942566/

Check out ellerscad_v4.scad, where I have various [recursive] functions involving dynamic arrays without involving list comprehensions. You
just have to store your variables as the arguments of the function.

Hi openSCAD,
for some reason when I remove the highlight '#' in the below macro, the two corresponding cubes simply vanish, instead of being added to the enclosing union. While my design works when I split the difference(), it would be nice to have it in one place, or maybe it is only my system?


$fn=25;
wall=3;
spacer=0.02;
neuH=93;
neuB=121;
oldH=86;
oldB=150;
shiftX=(oldB-neuB)/2;

difference(){
? union(){
??? translate([-shiftX+wall,0,0]) { cube([oldB,oldH,wall]); };
??? cube([neuB+2*wall,neuH+wall,6*wall]);
? #? translate([wall+neuB-30,0,0]) { cube([30,20,wall]); };
? #? translate([wall,neuH-17,0]) { cube([34,17,wall]); };? 
? };
? union(){
??? translate([wall,-spacer,wall+spacer]) {cube([neuB,neuH+spacer,5*wall+spacer]);};
??? translate([2*wall,4*wall-spacer,-wall]) {cube([neuB-2*wall,neuH-5*wall+spacer,7*wall]);};

Hadd me stumped for a minute...

The # makes it display that bit, even tho it is removed by the difference,
it is for debugging.

Try

$fn=25;
wall=3;
spacer=0.02;
neuH=93;
neuB=121;
oldH=86;
oldB=150;
shiftX=(oldB-neuB)/2;


difference(){
  color("black",0.3) union(){
    translate([-shiftX+wall,0,0]) cube([oldB,oldH,wall]); ;
    cube([neuB+2*wall,neuH+wall,6*wall]);

  };
  color("blue",0.3) union(){
    translate([wall,-spacer,wall+spacer])
{cube([neuB,neuH+spacer,5*wall+spacer]);};
    translate([2*wall,4*wall-spacer,-wall])
{cube([neuB-2*wall,neuH-5*wall+spacer,7*wall]);};
   // translate([0,0,0]) { cube([0,0,0]); };
    translate([-shiftX+oldB-6+wall,oldH-5,-20]) { cylinder(50,1.5,1.5); };
    translate([-shiftX+oldB-5.5+wall,16.2,-20]) { cylinder(50,1.5,1.5); };
    translate([-shiftX+29.8+wall,+5.7,-20]) { cylinder(50,1.5,1.5); };
    translate([-shiftX+6+wall,oldH-5,-20]) { cylinder(50,1.5,1.5); };
    translate([neuB-22.7+wall,12.6,-20]) { cylinder(50,2.35,2.35); };    
    translate([wall+26.5,neuH-9.5,-20]) { cylinder(50,2.35,2.35); };    
    translate([wall+neuB-30-70,2*wall,-spacer]) {cube([70,7,wall*2]); };
    translate([neuB-20,39,wall+6.2]) { rotate([0,90,0]) {
cylinder(50,1.5,1.5); }; };
    translate([-20,21.5,wall+10]) { rotate([0,90,0]) { cylinder(50,1.5,1.5);
}; };
    translate([-20,neuH-21.5,wall+10]) { rotate([0,90,0]) {
cylinder(50,1.5,1.5); }; };
  };
};

translate([wall+neuB-30,0,0]) cube([30,20,wall]); ;
translate([wall,neuH-17,0])  cube([34,17,wall]); ;  

That way you add the two extra bits AFTER the cutouts are done.

Hi!

They don't magically disappear and they are added to the union() but you
subtract them afterwards with 
    translate([2*wall,4*wall-spacer,-wall])
{cube([neuB-2*wall,neuH-5*wall+spacer,7*wall]);};

So you need to either make a more complex subtract shape or add your cubes
outside the difference()...

Nice.

You may need a method to ignore the separate colours and just do one STL,
for when color() is used for display/documentary reasons rather than
multi-material.

Hi, your post is still flagged as "This post has NOT been accepted by the

Check your registration as per  this.
<http://forum.openscad.org/mailing_list/MailingListOptions.jtp?forum=1>  

Re your question. Imported STLs are 3D objects, so difference() should work
on them just like on a cube(). If not it probably means the STL is not
manifold or is otherwise stuffed.

Get a copy of  Netfabb basic
<http://www.netfabb.com/downloadcenter.php?basic=1>   to check your STL, or
post a link to it and I can check it.

<http://forum.openscad.org/mailing_list/MailingListOptions.jtp?forum=1>  

Re your question. I think you are maybe looking for  children()
<https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Modules>  

module hole(distance_x, distance_y, rot, size) {
  difference() {
     children();
     // -
     rotate(a = rot, v = [1, 0, 0]) {
         translate([distance_x, distance_y, 0]) {
             cylinder(r = size, h = 100, center = true); 
     }
  }
}// hole

Then you can do

hole(32,15.5,0,5)
  hole(32,75-15.5,0,5)
    box(40 + 12 + 12, total_width, 12); 

etc.

2015.03 didn't just add list comprehensions, it also added 'concat'. With
concat, a function can now return a list whose length is determined at run
time. Before these additions, I agree that OpenSCAD was "a little too
limited".

Re your issue.

When I do:

import("5mm_Calibration_Steps_fixed.stl");

translate([40,0,0]) 
	import("5mm_Calibration_Steps_fixed.stl");

I get:


Compiling design (CSG Tree generation)...

Could be an OpenSCAD bug? But I have seen STLs which pass Netfabb but still
have issues....

Re your issue.

The linear extrude makes it a 3D object. Comment it out and do a F6 to see
the difference.

DXF only does 2D AFAIK.

Sorry, there is no default library as such.
You can have a library path, see  here.

You still need to 'include <yourthing.scad>', but at least you don't need to

Yes, I would like a settings dialog somewhere to select options for the
export. There are a number of ways to output to AMF for example, I picked
the method that is compatible with slic3r. As a consequence, color is a
proxy for material id, but it would be possible to have the same material
in different colors.

For a particular model, it might be useful to select which parts to export,
perhaps in an extended Export... dialog.

I would like to add a material property to the language, there is some
discussion about how this should be done. It would be good to have
something that is reasonably flexible and extensible which could also be
used for things like DXF layers.

At this point, there are a number of bugs, loose ends, and missing features
that I will work on. However, if there are any features people would like
to see relating to color, materials etc, now is a good time to let me know.

Note: you don't need to union all the subtracted bits. Difference() takes
multiple children and subtracts them all from the first child.

Thanks, added to OpenSCAD too...

(https://github.com/openscad/openscad/pull/1406)

I've validated against all color names from https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/
and the added RebeccaPurple is the only difference.

See  this FAQ.

Perhaps you have your 'Wireless' plugged in?

It also suggests you will need a longer list...

Ahh, indeed, I have :-).

I'm uploading a new snapshot, which has both IDs included and should report
something like:

InputDrivers: HidApiInputDriver (256f:c62f - 3Dconnexion Space Mouse Wireless)*

It includes some initial support for mapping events via configuration,
but there is no GUI yet.

The default config should be added when running the new version the first
time. Right now it's basically the axis number with +/- defining the
direction:

Unfortunately it's even more complicated. We already have two
different data decoders as the devices talk different protocols.
Maybe we can just add a separate file to allow loading additional
driver configurations in case the new device speaks something
that is already known.

Ideally all that would go into spacenavd, but it seems the
Win32 port is pretty much dead for years.

Going through the digest, I came across this message.  If it had been made in
the original topic I would have responded sooner.

gear_trains.scad <http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13421/gear_trains.scad>  

The uploaded file is from a series of files I am working on.  There is a
file for describing gears and another file with gear mounting options.  But
I think you will see in this file that I understand the power of OpenSCAD
and how to write very powerful functions.

But the point I was trying to make was that OpenSCAD is not procedural
language and nor should it be.  I am trying very hard to impress on people
that it doesn't necessarily make sense for it to have run time variables. 
Someday someone might come up with a method to shoe horn OpenSCAD into a run
time environment.  I don't think it is a very fruitful endeavor however.  
OpenSCAD does what it is supposed to do very well.  In fact, better than any
other language.  The way I see it, the developers are making great choices
about the which areas to work on next.

And list comprehensions is a huge step.  It has given us many things that
make it possible to make almost anything.  I once read somewhere that
OpenSCAD is not good for organic shapes.  Well that is no longer true.  I am
hard pressed to come up with something it can't do now.

The thing I am using a lot is sweeps.  It is replacing the unioned hulls. 
In my gears.scad file I was creating gears using the cutting gears concept. 
I was able to create spiral gears with unioned hulls.  But there was a big
problem doing them.  With bevel gears I could hull the trapezoidal shapes
and ultimately I was able to speed things up greatly with a scaled
linear_extrude of the trapezoidal shape.  But the spiral gears resist any
simple solution like that.  The sweep solves those problems.  In fact I am
looking at using the sweep to directly generate the spiral gear teeth and
skipping the cutting gear.  I expect it to be orders of magnitude faster
than my present approach.

I haven't worked on the gear stuff for a few months.  But I think the

of the file.

Message-ID: <1438597497620-13424.post@n5.nabble.com>

I'm trying to work this problem out and I've lost my way. Any help ?

input is a list of lists of perimeters (originally from inkscape) like this:
shape = [ 
	
[[-5.493165,6.432500],[-5.493165,-6.476440],[-5.152585,-7.322380],[-4.317625,-7.673950],[-0.659175,-7.673950],
		
[1.373295,-7.391052],[2.922365,-6.542360],[3.952333,-5.191037],[4.295655,-3.378290],[4.139100,-2.309872],

[5.493165,2.818000],[5.199280,4.309393],[4.317625,5.553590],[3.249208,6.330878],[1.801755,6.948860],
		
[-1.010745,7.542120],[-3.537595,7.673950],[-4.010005,7.673950],[-4.317625,7.651950],[-5.152585,7.300390],
		 [-5.493165,6.432470]],
	
[[-3.153075,5.245970],[-1.285395,5.125130],[0.878905,4.707640],[1.933595,4.323120],[2.680665,3.828740],
		
[3.153075,2.818000],[2.889405,1.906130],[2.109375,1.257940],[1.109625,0.939330],[-0.109865,0.807500],
		 [-3.153075,0.807500],[-3.153075,5.245970]],
	
[[-3.153075,-1.576540],[-0.988765,-1.576540],[0.164795,-1.697380],[1.098635,-2.005000],
		
[1.741332,-2.573543],[1.955565,-3.378290],[1.527105,-4.608760],[0.678410,-5.097655],[-0.659175,-5.267940],
		 [-3.153075,-5.267940],[-3.153075,-1.576540]]
		];
Its a capital B. (Outer perim and two inner holes).

The polygon statement needs this in one long list and three paths (last two
in correct winding order).
I'm trying to make a function to return that.

Currently jammed up on the simplest possible thing. Concat all the lists
together.
all_points = concat(shape);   // does not work.
all_points = concat([for (i=[0:len(shape)-1]) shape[i]]); // nope

I'm reluctant to build a recursive - I thought it'd be easier than that...
Any suggestions...? I think I need sleep :(

Thanks guys,  yes flattening does of course do it perfectly.
Now I need to move to the next step and reindex the three paths. The picture
above shows why the three paths can't be simply appended and I must use the
alternative form of Polygon (with paths) to cut holes in a single polygon.
Cheers and thanks for the help. sigh.. flatten.. sigh...

end result - in case anyone's interested is the unoptimised following:

// used by composite_shape
function flatten(list) = [ for (a = list) for (b = a) b ];
function reindex(list, start) = [for (i=[start:start+len(list)-1]) i];
function new_start(list, index) = len(flatten( [for (i=[0 : index-1])
list[i]] )); // don't care about index=0

module composite_shape(polygon_list) {
	if (len(flatten(polygon_list)) <= 2 * len(polygon_list))  // is it a nested
shape.
		// no its a sinple polygon
		polygon(polygon_list);
	else { // its a nested shape
		// append all the points in all the lists
		// make paths sequences to add to polygon with paths syntax.
		all_points = flatten(polygon_list);
		all_paths = [for (i=[0:len(polygon_list)-1]) reindex(polygon_list[i], i==0

I successfully created a ellipse shaped profile (thanks to the guys on this
forum helping out!). Now i want to engrave text on the flat outside of this
ring, but i cant figure out how i could do it. Anybody a good idea? Its a
tough one, trust me.

Please help!

I have had occasions where F5 works but F6 doesn't. I most cases wireframe
view (F11) fixes it.  Don't try to drop out of wireframe because then it
will crash.  This will allow you to create an STL, if that is your goal.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] To long to compile... How can we abort a compilation?
Message-ID: <1438642717903-13432.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi,
Geetings from Portugal. This is my first post to this forum. 

Can anyone explain how the simple code that follows takes so long to compile
(about half-an-hour).  
In addition the OpenSCAD editor stays locked, and the only way to abort the
compilation I found is to
kill the Windows process. 

The code:

/minkowski(){
      difference(){
         translate([0,0,20])cylinder(r=DCarrier/2+RSphere,h=1,center=true);
        translate([0,0,20])cylinder(r=DCarrier/2,h=1+delta,center=true);
      }
      sphere(r=RSphere);
   }/

It would be nice to have the possibility to terminate the compilation at
will, if we feel that something went wrong.  

Kind regards.

Something like this will give you the "projection" of the text on the
surface.  Bending the text to follow the surface would be very difficult. 

I am creating text that goes through the ellipse and intersecting a slightly
larger ellipse with it.  If you want more precise control over the thickness
of the text then do a minkowski with the base ellipse and a
cube([2*thickness,2*thickness,0.01],center=true).

It will take a long time to compile.

Steve

xy_scale = 1.02;
//Explicit Union, don't really need it
union(){
    intersection(){
        translate([0,0,5])
        rotate([90,0,90])
        linear_extrude(height=175)
        text("This is your text", halign="center", size = 16);
        translate([0,0,14.59]){
            scale([xy_scale,xy_scale,1])
            mirror([1,0,0]){

Hi Steve,

thanks for your reply, i will give your idea a shot tomorrow. I think you
are right,doing it accurately is very difficult, but it should be doable. I
saw this code bending text around a parabola, so i think it should be
possible to also bend it on an ellipsoid shape.
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:210099
<https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:210099>  

Although i dont know how to transfer the code on a generic ellipsoid shape
yet. Can you help?

Patrick

Thanks Peter,

your approach helped me a lot understanding more in OpenSCAD. I finally
managed to create a good ellipsoid shape, if you want to check it out, see

@PYM the scad_utils you reference don't contain shapes.scad, lists.scad and a
few others.
Where did you get those ones from ?

Maybe I should start a request for a sticky thread with the common libs
people include but aren't part of the OpenSCAD distro. We could keep it up
todate as OpenSCAD slowly includes their functionality (possibly).
I'm sure everyone has their favourites... ?

There's a red circle with an X at the far bottom right of the screen.. try
clicking it.

I used this stuff to run PYM's design.

https://github.com/openscad/scad-utils
<https://github.com/openscad/scad-utils>  

The other scad-utils has missing functions in addition to the missing files.
I think it must be an older version.

Hello,

yeah it is confusing, rickan's link is the correct one. Sorry for mixing up.
Anybody a solution yet? This problem drives me crazy!

There are two: let should be outside the brackets and there is an extra ,
g) at the end.

This has correct syntax but doesn't work

function bezier_helper(bezpoints,g) = (len(bezpoints) == 1) ? points[0] :
bezier_helper([ for( v = bezpoints) let( m = v + 1) getpt(points[v],
points[m], g)]);

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Blue icon on Win7
Message-ID: <CAEEmnrPUmBPhZ82xNrspuafx7ep9mngv4SiCKvXPDd1hscrr+A@mail.gmail.com>

I have recently updated from XP to Win7 64 bit and am running OpenScad
2015.05.16 (git e673fff).

The icon is yellow on the start menu and on files but blue and black on the
window and the task bar. Is this intentional or a bug? The blue version is
very indistinct.

It looks to me like it's not the , g) at the end that's extra but the ) in
front of the , g).

This also compiles: 

unction bezier_helper(bezpoints,g) = (len(bezpoints) == 1) ? points[0] :
bezier_helper([ for( v = bezpoints) let (m = v + 1) getpt(points[v],
points[m], g)], g);

And it matches the bezier_helper definition.

I can't see any red circle with an X in the Windows openSCAD port . Maybe in
the Linux port ...
I'm using openSCAD 2015_03-1. 
Thanks anyway.

The new version works, thanks. InputDrivers: HidApiInputDriver (256f:c62f -
3Dconnexion Space Mouse Wireless)*

I'll get you feedback after I fiddle and try some setting adjustments.

The only comment at this stage is the continued rotation when the mouse is
released to neutral. It needs a opposite lock to get out of the slide.
Interesting is it stops when the window loses focus, and continues when it
gets focus.

On win 7 the cancel is in the very lower right hand corner.
But your code is not responsive for me as well.

To get some results, you should decrease the number of facets by a lot (use
$fn for that)
Later for the final render/compile you can increase it again.

This code renders in 1min6sec
and compiles in 1min8sec (on a 1GHz netbook)

fn_sphere=8;
fn_cylinder=16;
RSphere=2;
DCarrier=10;
delta=2;
minkowski(){
      difference(){

translate([0,0,20])cylinder(r=DCarrier/2+RSphere,h=1,center=true,$fn=fn_cylinder);

translate([0,0,20])cylinder(r=DCarrier/2,h=1+delta,center=true,$fn=fn_cylinder);
      }
      sphere(r=RSphere,$fn=fn_sphere);
   }

a. Like this (for F6 Render). That's Windows 7/64.
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13449/Cancel_Button.jpg> 

b. 

With the variables I used, 25/3/0.01, Compile (F5) took 38s, the GUI did
lock-up, that needs looking into. Usually it doesn't take long, and doesn't
lock-up. Given minkowski is intense, perhaps it needs a event process or two
in the loops??

Render (F6) was instant.

What size was causing your looong compile?

It's stars on a night sky field... I always assumed it was just a clever 
way of reminding us that it's the nightly build. A little odd, but 
clever and effective.

Yes, it's intended to mark the nightly builds. I always found it confusing
to have two identical OpenSCAD icons in my application panel for the release
version and the nightly build.

To see it with all the details, the source is:?
The https://github.com/openscad/openscad/blob/master/icons/icon-nightly.scad
?

The difference is not intentional, it looks like the icon change did not
make it into the installer.

Hi jpmendes,

Your way to do it is complicated and VERY slow.

Try the code below for similar result much faster:


fn_sphere=360;
fn_cylinder=360;
RSphere=2;
DCarrier=10;
delta=2;

translate([0,0,20])
rotate_extrude($fn=fn_cylinder)
	translate([DCarrier/2,0,0]) rotate([0,0,90])
		minkowski(){
			square(delta,center=true);
			circle(r=RSphere,$fn=fn_sphere); }

Good luck with OpenSCAD, it is my favorite 3D CAD tool

Here's a starting point (untested):

for (i = [0:step:(1*quarter_segments/4)-step])
rotate (e_a (i), Z)
translate ([-e_r (i), -e_c (i), 0])
rotate (90, Z)
rotate (90, X)
linear_extrude (height)
text (t, valign = "center");


You'll need to figure out the formula for these functions:

e_r(i) gives you the radius from the center of your ellipse at that specific
point.

e_a(i) gives you the angle from the X axis for that particular point.

You should be able to get the e_r(i) and e_a(i) by converting e(i)'s coordinates
into polar coordinates.

e_c(i) gives you the partial circumference starting from i=0 until current i.
I'm still not sure about the formula for this.

Here's an animation to help you picture what's going on here:

Imagine that the red piece is your text. You need to emulate that with an
elliptical path.

Question 1

Is it acceptable to omit the curly braces after if and for statements if
there is only one child object?

Question 2

Should union() always be specified or is it OK to rely on implicit union
operations?

// example 1
if(true) cube(20);

// example 2
difference(){
translate([0,0,0]) {cube(30,center=true);cube(30);}
sphere(r=18);

// example 3 - combining 1 & 2
if(true) translate([10,0,0]) {cube(30,center=true);cube(30);}

Q1. Yes. Note it is often good to use round braces in the if expression, as
you have. e.g.

if (thisBooleanVariable) cube(); // in this exact case without () you get an
error
else sphere();

Q2.
implicit union() is only on the top level of the main program or a module
AFAIK.
using {} without a union(), in your ex. 2&3, can be problematic if it
contains geometry.

I think {} turns into group{} (not documented), I find it is inconsistent.
Don't use it.

Q1) round braces around the "if" expression are not just a good idea, they
are mandatory! :)

Q2) a statement such as translate () {...} used to create a group is fine,
but *will* perform implicit union. I normally use group() in that sort of
case, but group() and union() are equivalent.

"{A; B;}" does not become "group() {A;B;}" , it becomes "A; B;". Probably
not what is desired.

viz 

difference () 
{ 
    { cube(); sphere(); } 
    cube();
}
=> CSG Tree
group() {
	difference() {
		cube(size = [1, 1, 1], center = false);
		sphere($fn = 0, $fa = 12, $fs = 2, r = 1);
		cube(size = [1, 1, 1], center = false);
	}
}

There is another quirk in the syntax I noticed:

   cube () { cube(); }

compiles and renders without error/warning, but the second cube is ignored.

Bob,

Please do not confuse a beginner. You did not respond to his Q1.
He asked about the ?{}? around a single statement after an if() definition,
and you responded about the ?()? of the test itself.

Sorry, yes you are right! I was responding to Michael's comment, he confused
me talking about round braces.

For the OP, I believe that 

if (1) cube ();
if (1) { cube (); } 
if (1) group () { cube(); }
if (1) union () { cube(); }

are all identical in function.

OK thanks, in summary instead of writing:

    if() {translate() union{cube();cube();}}

it can simply be written as:

    if() translate() {cube();cube();}

I hope that the above is correct...

The only item I am now unsure of is group(), which does not appear to be
documented, but OpenSCAD clearly recognises.  Is it a deprecated boolean
operator?

Go to menu [View][Show CSG tree], where openscad display how shapes are
organized internally, you'll see lots of group() but no union(). Obviously
it's an internal thing.

The reason I said to avoid plain { } is the code below (cut down example),
with the commented out union() does not produce the same geometry as with
the uncommented union(). Both for F5 & F6. I came across this yesterday
morning, so it was fresh in my mind.

intersection() {
	cube();
	 //union()
		{
		sphere();
		cylinder(r=0.5,h=5,true);
		}

Yes, that seems like a bug, if not an unexpected feature. the "{..}" gets
flattened in the CSG tree:

group() {

  intersection() {

    cube(size = [1, 1, 1], center = false);

    sphere($fn = 0, $fa = 12, $fs = 2, r = 1);

    cylinder($fn = 0, $fa = 12, $fs = 2, h = 1, r1 = 0.5, r2 = 0.5, center
= false);

 }

}

There is no implicit union generated in this case, unlike "if () {...}".
I'm not sure whether this is an unintended side-effect of the syntax, or if
it is needed in some other case?

I don't recall seeing an issue for it, I'm not sure what keywords to search
for. I've probably stumbled across this a few times myself without
realising.

Given group() and the use of plain {} is undocumented, I just steer clear
most of the time.
I just use {} to group related variables so they can be collapsed in the
editor.

Another case where brackets and union are different is when you place them
around child objects. With a union or explicit group they all become the
first child but with braces they are multiple children.

I'm not sure what you're trying to do with the two different cylinders but
you're only subtracting the small red one from the larger one, rather than
the logo itself.

To 'punch a hole' you need to subtract the cylinder from the keychain like
this:

difference()
{
    *logo stuff goes here*
    cylinder(*dimensions of 'hole' to subtract from your keychain*);
}

If you want to make a more complex hole shape then you can just keep
subtracting more shapes.

By the way, you will need to make the cylinder a smidge taller than the
keychain and nudge it downwards by half a smidge (in the z-direction) so
that it fully intersects the logo above and below.

Also, $fn=100 is likely way above the resolution of your printer for
creating holes 7mm diameter holes.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Multiple arguments to -D in command line.
Message-ID: <1438990850145-13472.post@n5.nabble.com>

Could someone give me an example of passing multiple arguments to -D in
command line?

Passing this works:

-D value_type=100

But this:

-D "value_type=100,value_two_type=2"

Or

-D value_type=100 value_two_type=2

And similar variations, cause an error. 

What is the proper syntax?

Thanks,
Boris

Think of the ?-D? option as appending code to the end of the file, not passing a variable value in:

openscad -D ?value1=1;value2=\?a string\?? myCode.scad

Try this:

openscad -D ?cube();? dummy.scad -o cube.stl

?where ?dummy.scad? only contains a comment.

Very handy for dynamically generating content.

I just tried it,

it works with:

openscad -D v1=100 -D v2=50 -D v3=10 somefile.scad

Subject: [OpenSCAD] very insteresting command line behavior
Message-ID: <CAMyDR6J1tSxc+jVAbZx-HyVZ_9SExXXb-3u0ggRTuvsz2RSSgw@mail.gmail.com>

I just answered a question about the -D switch to the openscad command line
tool.

Then I noticed something that I had never noticed before.

Lets take a very simple script:
x = 1;  // 100
y = 1;  // 50
z = 1;  // 10

echo("x = ", x);
echo("y = ", y);
echo("z = ", z);

If I open this up in openscad, everytime I change the value of a variable
(x say), and then do a preview, it does what I expect it to, change x =
100; then it echos x = 100

BUT:

If I call it on the command line with the -D arg, then no matter what I
change the value to, it does NOT change the result! EVER!

like so:  openscad -D x=100 -D y=50 -D z=30 testvar.scad &

very Interesting! why?

Jerry, maybe you are expecting -D x=100 test.scad to provide a default
value for x, to be overridden by a definition of x within test.scad.

But that's not what -D is supposed to do. Instead, -D is used when you want
to override a definition in the source code using the command line, which
is very useful when you are invoking openscad non-interactively.

You are using -D and at the same time invoking scad interactively, which is
not the use case for which -D is intended.

Also note your post is still flagged as "This post has NOT been accepted by
the mailing list yet. " so it didn't get to the mailing list, where most
users are.

Sometimes that happens on a first post, when you next post, check it after a
few minutes. If it is still flagged as above, then check your  registration

As for the dynamic helix.
Check the post a couple back where another user has been making ellipses.

Not sure what you're asking. So;

a. Most people just read the emails which Nabble sends them. 
b. Many people do NOT read the web 'forum'  here.
<http://forum.openscad.org/>  
c. So, if you are NOT appropriately  registered.
<http://forum.openscad.org/mailing_list/MailingListOptions.jtp?forum=1>  
your posts do not go to the many people at a.
d. Sometimes a new register-person's first post doesn't make it for some
timing issue, but second posts are OK.
e. Every so-often, I go through the posts on the web forum, and any with
zero replies, I check to see if they are 'lost' posts which didn't make it
to the mailing list, and inform them of such.
f. If there is a problem they should do/redo the instructions  here.
<http://forum.openscad.org/mailing_list/MailingListOptions.jtp?forum=1>  
g. If that fails, they should post a help-me post to attract the attention
of the list admins.

There is an older but nice way to get text on cubes, cylinders, and
spheres:  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16193

This utility should probably be re-writen with text().

See if this helps:

for( i = [0 :360] ) { 
rotate([0,0,i])translate([20+sin(i*6)*2,0,cos(i*6)*2]) sphere(r=1,$fn=16);
rotate([0,0,i])translate([20+sin((i-30)*6)*2,0,cos((i-30)*6)*2])
sphere(r=1,$fn=32);}

Change your cylinder to circle and it works fine.

Message-ID: <1439132290984-13488.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hello,

I'm trying to make a *.scad to build molds for "complex" parts that cannot
simply molded using Flat touching surfaces of the two parts mold.

The input of what I'm willing to mold is an extruded DXF, or a STL.
For example, let's say I want to mold a curve (let's say like this one :
http://www.ironcad.com/products/IronCADV7/Images/IsoCurve.gif of a thicnkess
of 2mm), I'll need the parts of my mold to "follow" the shape of my curve, I
really cannot simply make a difference().

Do you know a way to do that ? (remember that curve is just an example, but
I need to do it with diff?rente shapes)

My idea is to make an approx using intersection() with very thin cubes, and
"ask" the software if intersection() { my_shape cube} does not intersect,
move the cube slightly (with a for() ) and try again until intersection() {
my_shape cube} actually doex something and keep a difference(){ cube
my_shape} to be a part of my mold.

If I do this on every single place of my shape (with another for() ), I'll
have a extrusion of my_shape top part, which will be the first part of my
mold. Doing the same at the bottom will produce a 2 parts mold of my_shape.

How can I do that ?
I'd like something like 
for (i = [0 : 100])
{
translate([0,0,-i])
cube([0.1,0.1,100]);

if intersection(){my_shape cube} = false, 
then start the for again (and iterate i )
}
else difference(){
translate([0,0,-i])
cube([0.1,0.1,100]);
my_shape
}

My problem is in the fact that I cannot find a way to know if intersection()
does something or not. I can only see it when it actually does nothing, the
debugger says "no top level object found"

Thank you for you help

You could try projection and cut=true as you translate object through Z.
But question remains - How to tell if you have any geometry as a result.
Unless you use an external program to examine the resulting shapes....

I think you can manage this with a simple difference()-minkowski() operation:

debug=true;
difference() {
	minkowski() {
		sphere(r=2.0);
		yourObject();
	}
	yourObject();
	if(debug) {
		cube([100,100,100],center=false);
	}
}

That will get you a ?shell? 2.0 units thick around the ?yourObject(); empty volume.

Caveat: If ?yourObject();? has hollow volumes, those will be positive-space volumes suspended in the resulting shape.

Otherwise, if you do really want a ?geometric selection? operator you?ll have to do something like this:

https://github.com/clothbot/ClothBotCreations/blob/master/examples/quantize.scad <https://github.com/clothbot/ClothBotCreations/blob/master/examples/quantize.scad>

It?s non-trivial and rather computationally intensive to say the least, but it works? after a fashion. :-)

Have a look at the command surface().

Here are some links interesting links if you can convert your surface to a
grey scale image.
There are some different ways to import them into OpenSCAD:

On second-reading, I?ve been playing with some ?directed minkowski? module code that may be of use:

https://github.com/clothbot/ClothBotCreations/blob/master/utilities/directed_minkowski.scad <https://github.com/clothbot/ClothBotCreations/blob/master/utilities/directed_minkowski.scad>

You could try using it to create a ?directed up? half and a ?directed down? half.

The loop
for (i = [0 : Step:100])
{  function z   {  ... }
   function z-height   {  ... }
   translate([x,y,z])
   cube([0.1,0.1,z-height]);
}
is enough to do it. All it takes is to obtain a mathematical expression for
the coordinates x,y,z and the amplitude z-height of your thing-to-be-made.
One way of doing that is by using Bezier functionality. See e.g. 
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8786/#files
Another is to enter the coordinates as lists and write an extraction
routine. This is how http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:59817/#files creates
letters from cubes.

Enjoy!

Sorry, there is a mistake in the code fragment I sent
You don't need 4 dimensions to describe a 3-D object
This will do

for (i = [0 : Step:100])
{  function z   {  ... }    //  here you enter z=f(x,y) the coordinates of
your surface and get the height as response
   translate([x,y,0])
   cube([Step,Step,z]);   //as union() is implied by a for loop, no need to
call it
} 

For more details, look up in http://www.thingiverse.com for either "openscad
height maps" or" bezier" to find more

Hi there!

I've spent a few hours designing this rounding for a part of mine, which
already is quite complex (to my eyes at least):



and now I've found that it sadly won't do since I need it angled - I'll try
to explain: at the moment it hits the smaller part in 90? angle on both
sides, but i need it in 75? on the one side and in 105? on the other. 

If the discription is unclear, or you wanna take a look at the bigger
picture, this is my work in progress quadcopter frame for which arm this
rounding is for:  playground_v5.scad

Clothbot's fillet.scad is great stuff for this purpose.

https://github.com/clothbot/ClothBotCreations/blob/master/utilities/fillet.scad

Unfortunately, it uses multiple minkowski()s which makes it horribly expensive
to use, so I try to avoid using it whenever there is a simple enough way to
implement it (e.g. 90? fillets using filleted_cylinder() and filleted_cube() in 
https://github.com/hyperair/deltabob/blob/master/utils.scad).

Is there some getting started guide or something like that for how to use
these libraries?

You use fillet() like you would use a union(), and fillet will try to fillet any
joints it sees. It doesn't work too well with individual concave children
becauses it uses hull(), but it works very well at generating fillets at concave
joints between children.

For filleted_cylinder() and filleted_cube(), they just work like their cube()
and cylinder() counterparts, but with an additional fillet_r parameter (and in
the case of cube(), fillet_sides which allows you to specify which sides to
fillet (sometimes you don't want all the sides filleted). filleted_cube() also
has an extended "center" argument that takes an 3-element vector of sides to
center upon. MCAD's X, Y, and Z constants work well for this, like
filleted_cube(..., center = X + Y, ...);

thanks for your reply. I got filet to work but its incredibly slow, and I'm
not even close to the resolution I was thinking about....

The deltabob/utils.scad if I understood it correctly won't do angled
roundings between two objects, but only round one or multiple sides of a
single object?
Also I guess I would need to find out about this MCAD library that it seems
to depend on...

You can increase the resolution by specifying the radius and steps.

It's just a shortcut to make a cube with a filleted base, and a cylinder with a
filleted base, because it's simple to do and much faster than using fillet (...)
{ cube (...); base (); }

As long as you can work in 2d, you can use the offset() command.
Its very fast.

Have a look at some code I once wrote:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:142798
It does a fillet between any (concave) shape and a plane.
It is slow, as it uses minkowsky(), but as long as you increase fn_fillet
slowly you should be fine.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] are there easier ways to get round edges?

Look at the sweep function made possible with the newest OpenSCAD.  There are
several ways to create a path.  In your case directly creating the path with
list comprehensions is the probably the best way.

A path is simply a list of transformation matrices like the multimatrix.  In
the scad-utils library you can see how they are done in
"transformations.scad".  Each transformation can not only have a translation
for a point on the path, it can have rotations and scaling as well.  By
mathematically defining the shape you want using the scaling you can create
almost any shape.  In your case the math is fairly simple.

For some reason the sweep is not part of the scad utils.  It is in the list
comprehension demos.  Both can be found in the OpenSCAD github 
https://github.com/openscad <https://github.com/openscad>  

Sweep uses the transformation list created for the path to transform a 2D
shape at each point.  It connects the corresponding vertices of the
transformed shape back to the transformed 2D shape at the previous step
forming a polyhedron 3D shape.  You could use a half circle or quarter
circle which is scaled as needed.  You probably want a straight path.

The path can be almost anything. I have used this technique to fillet
unusual paths.  For example, I added fillets to fins on a jet ski impeller.
The fins were sweeps as well.  I could use the same base path for both. 
Just change the 2D shapes and the scaling.

BTW, another great way to create paths are trajectories.  They are pretty
easy to understand. The quantize_trajectories will turn the trajectories
into a path.  There may be a way to add scaling directly to the trajectory,
but I usually take that path and apply the scaling in another list
comprehension.

I didn't recommend using the trajectories in your case, because I believe
you will be translating on a straight line.  Your math needs to relate to
the translation values.  You should do it all together.

hey there guys!

Thank you for all your answers!

At the moment I've copied the fillet function suggested by Chow Loong Jin
from
https://github.com/clothbot/ClothBotCreations/blob/master/utilities/fillet.scad
(find my current development stage as attachment: )
playground_v7.scad
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13508/playground_v7.scad>  

I adapted my code to just intersect the 4 raw cubes that I need it to, to
make the processing time halfway bareable. I am used to processing times of
under a second, with this library I'm at 3,5 minutes (just for the preview,
the rendering takes much longer, I think around 20 minutes but I'm not
sure...)

The suggestion by Peter Falke to use offset() won't work, cause I need a 3D
fillet.
I could not get the library also suggested by Peter Falke
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:142798 to work. The sample does only render
a fillet for the part2() module, not for the part3() as shown in the
screenshots on thingiverse.com - I am using OpenSCAD 2015.03-1 and when it
runs your code it tells me: "DEPRECATED: child() will be removed in future
releases. Use children() instead. " - My tries to get fillets for self
designed parts all failed, though I tried only for 5 minutes or so. Maybe
you can give some explanations how to use your library. (I don't really
understand how exactly he deciceds where the fillet is needed when you only
call it with one part without the other one it should be intersecting?)

I'm now gonna take a look at the sweep function, but I guess I first need to
find out about how to make my OpenSCAD installation find dependencies like
<scad-utils/linalg.scad> and those from MCAD.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Object not occuring when include several times same
	.scad-file.
Message-ID: <1439403791879-13513.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hello OpenSCAD community

I am new to 3D modelling and relatively equal newbe to programming-code so
please have mercy on my thread if this subject is already covered or if
there might be an easy piece-of-cake solution to this.

I am trying different means of indexing the code. My, so far, best-build
option of index is by making each object for itself (fx a tube) then halfing
it in another. (new shape, new file). Though it requires a (possibly) large
chain of "include<*.scad>; each for every file.

The problem is that i have made a plate, a halfpipe, a plate-and-a-halfpipe,
and now want to make a file several of the plateandhalfpipe. But the
halfpipe is missing on the second (and third) include of the same file so
that it is only the plate.

This is the code:

include<vinge.scad>;
translate([0,69,0])
include<vinge.scad>;
translate([0,100,0])
include<vinge.scad>;

It?s made public so that people can play with it and people who are interested in digging deep can do so.

Well I didn't come across an answer that solved the include-issue but I found
out another solution to the central problem itself. Exporting the
shape/object as .stl and using import-method made it without any parts of
the object missing. 

I guess that it is a question of difference between a modelled/rendered
item, and the code for making it - but it is only a guess.

You don't show the contents of 'vinge.scad'. But i can guess the problem.

The include <filename> statement is implemented by replacing the text
'include <filename>' with the contents of 'filename', and then interpreting
the resulting text as an OpenSCAD script.

Since vinge.scad implements plate-and-a-halfpipe, I suppose it contains
more than one top-level statement (after include statements are processed).
I'm guessing the plate is the first statement, and the halfpipe is the
second statement. So in

translate([0,69,0])
include<vinge.scad>;

after expanding the include, then you'll have something like

translate([0,69,0])
plate();
halfpipe();

and the translate will only be applied to the plate, not to the halfpipe.
So you have three identical halfpipes superimposed at the same position.

I recommend that you switch to a different coding idiom. Each include file
defines a module of the same name, and the module is explicitly invoked by
the including script. So your code will look like this:

include<vinge.scad>;

vinge();
translate([0,69,0]) vinge();
translate([0,100,0]) vinge();

The code for vinge.scad is: 
/cube([35,1,135]);

translate([0.1,0.5,0])
include<halfcylinder2.scad>/

I am not familiar with how you achieve to make or to use the 'selfmade'
methods such as vinge() (for me it looks like another "translate()"-method.
I guess that these are what is called "Classes" and can be inherited by
other fragments of code and reshaped/modelled for specific purpose.(Change
of color etc)

But what I am understanding is that my library will be better of
constructing the model from the different parts of the objects (plate,
halfpipe) for themselves and linking to the most simple objects in itself,
then by rotating/translating or what else needs to be done. Different from
the accumulating progress i had before.

I 'punctured' the difference cylinder-issue by adding more lenght to the
cylinder i am using for subtraction. (z-coord = +0.2 or so.) and then making
the translate([x,y,z-0.1]) slightly larger. That way i have 0.1 unit more
each side of the holes to subtract the 'skin'.

Following up on what doug said:

You are trying to treat a scad file as a unit of geometry. In OpenSCAD,
that is handled with a module.

Replace the code for vinge.scad with this definition:

   module vinge()
   {
      cube([35,1,135]);
      translate([0.1,0.5,0])
         halfcylinder2();
   }

Assuming the code for halfcylinder2.scad, looks something like this:

   intersection() {
       cylinder( h=10, r=5, center=true );
       translate([5,0,0]) cube([10, 10, 11], center=true )
   }

you could define the module halfcylinder2 as

   module halfcylinder2()
   {
       intersection() {
           cylinder( h=10, r=5, center=true );
           translate([5,0,0]) cube([10, 10, 11], center=true )
       }
   }

To get it to render, you would then call the module as:

   vinge();

To translate these, you could do

   vinge();
   translate([0,69,0]) vinge();
   translate([0,100,0]) vinge();

It seems that the only piece you are missing here is the use of a
module for a reusable piece of geometry.

I know a total remake of the menus have been discussed before but could we

It might seem like a minor detail but I find that panning, zooming,

zooming the extents / "View all" except clicking the button interrupts the

Message-ID: <1439753181735-13528.post@n5.nabble.com>

I have been having trouble using the animate feature in OpenSCAD to dump
picture files. It largely numbers the output files consecutively, however
there is the occasional gap, e.g. it will jump from "frame00127.png" to
"frame00129.png" missing out "frame00128.png".  The behaviour appears in

anyone confirm this behaviour or am I doing something wrong?Thanks.

My theory is that "frame00128.png" is missing because either "frame00127.png"
or "frame00129.png" are used twice.

After looking at the source code, I guess this a fixable bug in OpenSCAD,
which is caused by the imprecise way that $t is computed and referenced at
each iteration. $t is represented internally as a 6 digit decimal character
string; it is incremented like this:

                        double s = this->e_fsteps->text().toDouble();
                        double t = this->e_tval->text().toDouble() + 1/s;
                        QString txt;
                        txt.sprintf("%.5f", t >= 1.0 ? 0.0 : t);
                        this->e_tval->setText(txt);

and referenced like this:

        this->top_ctx.set_variable("$t",
ValuePtr(this->e_tval->text().toDouble()));

and

                QString filename;
                double s = this->e_fsteps->text().toDouble();
                double t = this->e_tval->text().toDouble();
                filename.sprintf("frame%05d.png", int(round(s*t)));
                img.save(filename, "PNG");

There is a lot of roundoff error occurring at each step, due to this code.
I think the problem would go away if the iteration count were stored
internally as an integer, and if $t were computed at each step as
iteration_count/fsteps.

Thanks for your comments, glad it is not just me. Hopefully someone can fix
this, it does not sound too difficult.

In my opinion it would also be useful if the Dump Pictures control were a
button rather than a tick box. When the button is pressed $t would be set to
0, a complete cycle of output would be completed $t: 0/Steps ->
(Steps-1)/Steps, then the button would reset to unpressed.

On a side note, when I first tried your code, I cound not find the exported
files.
Only after a save the files apeared in the same folder as the save of the
file.

I have used the OpenSCAD command line interface to provide a temporary
solution. It is a bit slow but works OK. Note $vpr, $vpt & $vpd have no
effect.

OpenSCAD:

// initialise command line variables & calculate $t
$frame=0;
$frames=1;
$t=$frame/$frames;

text(str("frame ",$frame," of ",$frames));
translate([0,-20,0]) text(str("$t=",$t));

DOS batch file "AnimateSCAD.bat" (tested under Win7):

@ECHO OFF
REM AnimateSCAD.bat - Trygon 17Aug2015
REM Usage: AnimateSCAD SCADfilename number_of_frames
REM Generates sequentially numbered png files starting at "frame1000.png"
REM Deletes any existing frame png's before starting

setlocal ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION

IF "%~1"=="" GOTO error1
IF NOT EXIST "%~1.scad" GOTO error2

IF EXIST frame*.png DEL frame*.png

REM test if command line argument #2 exists
IF "%~2"=="" (
  SET /A m=1
  ECHO Number of frames not specified, defaulting to 1
) ELSE (
  SET /A m=%~2
  ECHO Number of frames !m!
)

SET /A n=0

:loop
SET /A f=n+1000
ECHO Frame !n! of !m!
"c:\Program Files\OpenSCAD\openscad" -D $frame="!n!" -D $frames="!m!" -o
frame!f!.png^
    --imgsize=1280,684 --projection=p --camera=0,0,0,0,0,0,400 "%~1.scad"
SET /A n=n+1
IF !n! GEQ !m! GOTO end
IF !n! EQU 9000 GOTO error3
GOTO loop

:error1
ECHO No scad file specified, execution aborted.
ECHO Usage: AnimateSCAD SCADfilename number_of_frames
GOTO end

:error2
ECHO Scad file "%~1.scad" does not exist, execution aborted.
GOTO end

:error3

:end
endlocal

While this would probably solve the rounding issue, it will change the
behavior as currently the user can enter a specific $t value in the GUI
too. As always the big question is if that's actually used...

Hi Torsten.

When the $t value is updated in the GUI,
the internally stored iteration count needs to be updated as well,
using this existing logic:

                QString filename;
                double s = this->e_fsteps->text().toDouble();
                double t = this->e_tval->text().toDouble();
                filename.sprintf("frame%05d.png", int(round(s*t)));
                img.save(filename, "PNG");

So the iteration count is set to int(round(s*t)).

The fact that a specific Time value can be entered, is in my opinion
confusing.

If a Steps value of 4 is used and no Time value is entered $t cycles through 
0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 0.00, 0.25, etc. as expected.

However if for example Time is set to 0.10 and Steps to 4, $t take the
following values: 0.10, 0.35, 0.60, 0.85, 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 0.00,
0.25, etc.. This to me is not expected.

If the facility for a user to set the the currect time step is desirable,
perhaps the user should be able to set a Step value rather than a Time
value, in conjunction with the existing Steps value, e.g. if Steps is set to
4, Step could be set to 0,1,2 or 3. Time is then calculated as Step/Steps.

The following program provides a detailed analysis of what actually happens
during animate at different Steps values, certainly not exciting but perhaps
useful:

echo("Cumulative shift:");
echo("+ve>0.5 gaps in frame numbering, -ve<-0.5 frames overwritten");
for(steps=[994:1007]){
    dt=1/steps;
    dt_5dp=round(dt*100000)/100000;//round to 5 decimal places
    frames_saved=ceil(1/dt_5dp);
    dt_error=dt_5dp-dt;
    cuml_error_time=dt_error*(frames_saved-1);
    cuml_error_frames=cuml_error_time/dt;
    echo(str("Steps:",steps,", Cumulative shift:",cuml_error_frames,
             " [frames], frames saved:",frames_saved));
    }

Output:

ECHO: "Cumulative shift:"
ECHO: "+ve>0.5 gaps in frame numbering, -ve<-0.5 frames overwritten"

ECHO: "Steps:1006, Cumulative shift:-4.1006 [frames], frames saved:1011"
ECHO: "Steps:1007, Cumulative shift:-3.1007 [frames], frames saved:1011"

Taking two Steps values as examples:

1) Steps=996, expected output 996 frames.

1000 frames are saved, but because of the cumulative time shift of -4
frames, 4 of these frames are overwritten by subsequent frames with the same
name. There are no obvious gaps in the output, but 4 frame files are in fact
missing.

The required time increment per step is 1/996=0.001004... but this is
effectively rounded to 5dp so it becomes 0.00100, which is smaller than the
required time increment. When step 126 is reached,
$t=0+(126-1)*0.00100=0.125 so the file name is 0.125*996=124.5 which becomes
"frame00125". However at the next step, 127, $t=0+(127-1)*0.00100=0.126 so
the file name is 0.126*996=125.496 which becomes "frame00125" again,
overwritting the previous frame.

2)Steps=1005, expected output 1005 frames.

1000 frames are saved, but because of the cumulative time shift of +5
frames, there are 5 gaps in the sequence of file names generated.  These are
obvious on inspection of the output.

The required time increment per step is 1/1005=0.000995... but this is
effectively rounded to 5dp so it becomes 0.00100, which is largerer than the
required time increment. When step 100 is reached,
$t=0+(100-1)*0.00100=0.099 so the file name is 0.099*1005=99.495 which
becomes "frame00099". However at the next step, 101,
$t=0+(101-1)*0.00100=0.1 so the file name is 0.1*1005=100.5 which becomes
"frame00101", so file name "frame00100" is skipped.

Wake up! ;-)

I believe, as Doug suggested, that the current step should be held as an
integer and $t calculated from this as step/steps, incrementing from 0/steps
to (steps-1)/steps.

Cheers, Trygon

Subject: [OpenSCAD] request: surface() from 2D array
Message-ID: <8CE8C868C8B74ADAA8BB9E73EF801E34@gmail.com>

Would it be difficult to modify the surface module to be able to build from an 2D array within OpenSCAD rather than loading an external file? I've found ways to get the same result, but they are MUCH slower. What I'd like to do is, for example, produce an array from a mathematical function, then feed it to surface() to visualize the function. I know I could generate the function externally and create a file (or probably even pipe it to OpenSCAD on the command line), but I'd like to be able to do everything from within the OpenSCAD file.

That's probably not too complicated, it's relatively easy to do in
user-space though, see

https://github.com/openscad/list-comprehension-demos/blob/master/3d-function.scad

for an example that shows a function z = f(x, y).

ciao,
  Torsten.

I hadn't thought about using polyhedron to do it. I learned OpenSCAD back when polyhedron was utterly useless because recursion wasn't allowed and it was thus impossible to programmatically build arrays. 

Trying the demo, it's exactly what I was trying to do. The solution I came up with using a lot of convex hull operations generates slightly cleaner results because it determines the best orientation to split each quad into triangles, but it's not nearly as fast as this.

Thanks.

It would still by nice to be able to use surface on a set of points generated this way, instead of using polyhedron, though.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] new version rocks - request for improvement
Message-ID: <5E0AE60B-A886-491B-9133-296C0704883F@gmail.com>

I finally got around to updating to the latest and greatest.  We wait for a slow time to avoid nasty surprises when we are on deadline.

Very nice - especially ?text?, which eliminates about half of my STL hacking.  (we pause for polite giggling as this reveals how long it?s been since we upgraded).

But, on that topic - I have extensive needs to import fairly large STL files and either incorporate them into designs, or use OpenSCAD to do simple modifications (for example, carving away pieces).  Alas, I believe that memory limitations are making this infeasible for many of the STL files I need to process.  So, I end up writing a lot of ad hoc STL-modification programs (in Java, mostly) to do what I need.  It?s not that difficult, but it?s tedious.

I would appreciate clues on how to MAXIMIZE the amount of memory available to OpenSCAD, and also some better diagnostics when OpenSCAD fails to open an STL file.  All I see now is ?could not open file?, when the file is perfectly well formatted, but perhaps large.  Other programs open the file just fine.  I?m assuming it?s a memory problem - but no error message tells me that.  No reason is given, at all - simply ?could not open?.

So:

a) how do I find our *why* an .stl file fails to open, and
b) if it is a memory issue, how do I maximize the amount of memory available
   to OpenSCAD to use when opening .stl files?

Without looking at the details, the only suggestion would be to
check if it's a 64 bit OpenSCAD running on a 64 bit System.

Can you share some specific example cases with all the files?

ciao,

Yes - just :

   import(?file.stl?, convexity=10);

fails

I?ll try to create a concrete example, and perhaps experiment to nail down whether or not it?s a size issue.

Since file size is an issue (potentially) - please send (privately) an e-mail address to receive instructions on fetching the files.

But?I?m on deadline for the next few days and don?t have a lot of time to spend working on this - sorry.

I?ll try?

Well, of course, as so often happens, producing the smallest piece of code that illustrates the bug causes the bug to disappear.

My apologies.  It?s entirely likely that I mistyped a filename, or an extension, but all trace of what I *actually* did are gone.  My original point was: the error message didn?t help.
It might have been any one of:

a) file does not exist
b) file is not an .stl file
c) file is not properly formated .stl
d) file is too big


Ah?here?s a history:

a) I tried import using an old system
b) it failed with the cryptic error message
c) I found ?text? in the manual
d) I tried that - it failed because I had not updated
e) I updated
F) The Princeton Band
g) text worked

So?I was happy.  Then I complained.  My bad.  Whatever the problem was, it is now gone.  Perhaps it was a mismatch in syntax or semantics between the old system and the new.
All appears well, now - and there is little point trying to recreate the problem on an obsolete version.

But now?to get to my main point:

HOW BIG an stl file should I expect to be able to import into the latest stable version of OpenSCAD? (assume a reasonably loaded Mac Pro, or (if it matters) a MacBook Pro)

Can I change that?  (that is, are there incantations which can allocate more memory) - presumably both for the .stl file AND the internal data structure that gets built from it.
When will I choke cgal?

Now that the system is so much improved, I will want to go back to previous failed attempts to read in huge STL files and do things like splitting them into 3D tiles.  My application is that I run a 3D Print Lab in a Computer Science department.  I can WRITE a Java program to do this (I wrote a reasonably competent STL package many years ago, and, if necessary, I could write a ?streaming STL? program to do it ?on the fly? using minimal memory), and there are many systems that CLAIM to be able to do this - but the only ones I have found to work (other than my own) are commercial packages that I can?t afford.  Of course, it?s trivial in OpenSCAD - so that?s my preferred choice.

My question is: how far can I push this.  I have volume datasets that contain millions and millions of triangles (convexity = 10000?).

Again - I *can* do it in Java (in practice, this is a good exercise for students, but they rarely deliver an ?industrial strength? solution) - but I prefer to do it in OpenSCAD.

The question is: is it feasible?

Ok - I?ll go off and see if I can read my biggest .stl file into the new, improved OpenSCAD. 
Wish me luck!

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Windows 10 and OpenGL issue
Message-ID: <1439940356967-13547.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi, 
Tonight I took the plunge and upgraded to windows 10. 
The first thing I ran after upgrading was OpenSCAD as I love it. 

I received this message: 

"Warning: Missing OpenGL capabilities for OpenCSG - OpenCSG has been
disabled. 

It is highly recommended to use OpenSCAD on a system with OpenGL 2.0 or
later. 
Your renderer information is as follows: 
GLEW version 1.12.0 
GDI Generic (Microsoft Corporation) 
OpenGL version 1.1.0" 

I accepted the warning, but my latest design was a mess - all the
Differences were missing in the preview.  But when I F6 rendered it, it all
looked OK. 

A bit of research indicates that it is something to do with the graphics
driver - I have an old Intel G45/G43 chip set.  Windows tells me that it is
'up to date' and I have checked with Intel downloads, and it appears to be
the latest one. 

Has anyone else had problems with OpenSCAD upgrade to windows 10, and any
idea how I fix this? 

Thanks.

Can you do a copy paste of "help/show library" info ? 

I assume that your GL_RENDERER_STRING &c should be something like
"Intel(R) G45/G43 Express Chipset",  but you are getting stuff like "GDI
GENERIC" which leads me to think that possibly your system is lacking
some support for that video chipset.  

Here is a relevant link (i did a google search for "G45 Windows 10")
https://communities.intel.com/thread/78041 which would indicate there
may not be drivers for G45 out for Windows 10.

I would be curious if you are able to run any other 3d programs on your
machine? For example Song Ho Ahn's Framebuffer basic example (fbo.zip)
at http://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_fbo.html

I have been testing OpenSCAD on Windows 10 in a virtual machine and have
seen some problems with OpenCSG preview mode, the basic no-frills
Microsoft OpenGL32.dll driver lacks support for the basic OpenGL
features that OpenCSG depends on. 
 
Thanks

HI Donbright

You are correct about the GL Renderer being GDI Generic.  From the other
posts I can see that the Intel(R) G45/G43 Express Chipset does not have the
support for windows 10, and will not in the future :-(

It looks like I will have to go and by a graphics card.  Better go tell the
wife!

Thanks for your help.

It is my impression that all of Windows development is funded by the 
graphics card purveyors.  I had to buy a new graphics card ... scratch 
that ... a new computer to go from Win 8 to Win 8.1 because GL broke.  I 
figure I'm due for another computer in the next few months.  Sigh.

Hmm... good to know.  We have a bunch of Core2 Duo Dells at our
hackerspace with Intel G45/G43 chips.  They are old enough to be
donated frequently.  I run Mint 17 on them, and I do use them for
OpenSCAD workstations (along with Arduino, and several other
development toolchains).

I suppose they would run Win7, but we aren't going to spend a bunch of
money on licenses for hardware that old.

Thanks for your help. I want to thank also all the guys who posted useful
suggestions. Yes the code I wrote was not very efficient, I was then
starting with openSCAD. Now I'm a little more confident.
However when I wrote that I couldn't see the red button I meant the "F5" CSG
tree compilation not the "F6" rendering. At CGAL rendering time the editor
is not blocked.  So I still find useful to have a possibility to stop the
GSG tree compilation at will. One example is, to try several types of code
and to chose the one more efficient without having to wait lots of time.
Also the editor should be independent of the compilation processes to
maintain the responsiveness. I would like to have the possibility to be
compiling one module and to be working on the code of another module
simultaneously. The compilation could be done over an automatically
generated backup copy of the actual file.
Yes I know I have to buy another PC, my dual core AMD 64 Athlon is now 10
years old. :)
Thanks allot.
Kind regards.

Hi,

I'm trying to create a teardrop shape using OpenSCAD - however I'm getting
issues with the rendering. It is only giving me a semicircle, yet in preview
it looks exactly how I want it to.
 
I have tried to translate the triangular portion so that it is inside the
semicircle, however this didn't seem to help.

Thanks,
Ed


radius = 15;
height = 10;
length = 50;

union () {
    difference() {
        cylinder(h=height,r=radius,center=false,$fn = 100);
        translate([-radius,0,0])//translate so centered
        cube(size=[radius*2, radius*2, height], center=false, $fn = 100);
//have so semicircle, slightly larger
    }
    //translate([0,-0.5,0])
    polyhedron( //triangle
    points = [
    [-radius,0,0],[radius,0,0],[0,length,0], //bottom
    [-radius,0,height],[radius,0,height],[0,length,height] //top
    ],
    faces = [
    [3,4,5],[0,1,2], //top and bottom
    [0,3,5],[0,5,2], // -x to y
    [0,4,3],[0,4,1], // -x to x
    [1,4,2],[4,5,2] // x to y
    ], $fn = 100
    );
    }

Hi regressor,

try

translate([0,0,20])
hull() {
	scale([1,1,10/30]) sphere(15);
	translate([0,50,0]) sphere(0.01);
}

translate([0,0,-20])
hull() {
	cylinder(h=10,r=15);
	translate([0,50,0]) cylinder(h=10,r=0.01);
}

Check View/Thrown-together (after F5 - maybe need to Design/Flush-cache) the
purple shows your polyhedron is inside out.

You also want to difference() something slightly bigger than the first object
otherwise the preview looks bad (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-fighting),
like so


s=0.01;

union () {
    difference() {
        cylinder(h=height,r=radius,center=false,$fn = 100);
        translate([-radius,0,-s])//translate so centered
        cube(size=[radius*2, radius*2, height+s*2], center=false, $fn =
100); //have so semicircle, slightly larger
    }

...

I'd suggest Ctrl-\ (aka |) for center, Ctrl-/ (aka ?) for reset view & Ctrl-'
(single quote aka ") for View-All. 

Three keys in a diagonal line-ish. 

I'd save keys <, and >. pair for something which goes up/down "< >".

That leaves ;: and `~ keys, perhaps Ctrl-; (aka :) toggles
perspective/orthogonal? 

And save ~ for future feature....

If the model should stay as a flat object, it might be helpful to create
the shape in 2D and just extrude that at the end. In most cases that's
much faster then directly going to 3D and has no risk of producing
problematic geometry.

radius = 15;
height = 10;
length = 50;

linear_extrude(height = height) {
	hull() {
		circle(r = radius);
		translate([0, length]) circle(r = 0.1);
	}
}

I guess the main reason for this is the usage of intersection with many
objects. Some details of the effect regarding the preview are explained
in https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/FAQ#Why_is_the_preview_so_slow.3F

A simple workaround (at the expense of a slower initial preview) is to
prefix all the intersection() definitions with render(), e.g.

module dodecahedron()
{
    rotate([0,0,-90])
    render() intersection(){
        rotate(a=0, v=[0,0,1]){
...

This will force the intersection result to be generated as mesh making
the calculation slower but preventing the CSG tree explosion.

ciao,
  Torsten.

Is there a way to change the recursion limit? in a CFG file or something? I
have seen it mentioned and i cannot find an option for it.

No, there is no configuration for that. OpenSCAD tries to limit recursion
according to the available stack space, trying to maximize the nesting
level.

There is basic support for tail-call-elimination which turns specific cases
of recursion calls into loops. This currently cuts out at 1000000 iterations
to prevent infinite loops.
(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call)

you could probably do the same inside a recursion, with every recursion
calling the variable with an additional change on it. I have that in a
recursion and i am trying to convert it to a loop because recursion limits
and it's difficult.

Ok i have found that i can't change the multimatrix var inside the loop
because openSCAD can't change variables. i am confused what to do ... hum.

Message-ID: <1440103199584-13570.post@n5.nabble.com>

i wish to chain cubes end to end inside a loop, so that i can construct a
spiral made of cubes only using dynamic rules of how they are added together
rather than a parametric equation. i.e. translate 1, tilt 20', rotate-z
10'... would make a 3d spirograph. 

Here is an example file using openscad recursion (which memory-crashes very
fast compared to openscad loops) i wish to do the same using a loop? i am
confused. 

    levels = 50; // number of levels for the recursion 
    
    len = 100; // length of the first segment 
    thickness = 5; // thickness of the first segment 
    
    // the identity matrix 
    identity = [ [ 1, 0, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 1, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 1, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 0,
1 ] ]; 
    
    // random generator 
    function rnd(s, e) = rands(s, e, 1)[0]; 
    
    // generate 4x4 translation matrix 
    function mt(x, y) = [ [ 1, 0, 0, x ], [ 0, 1, 0, y ], [ 0, 0, 1, 0 ], [
0, 0, 0, 1 ] ]; 
    
    // generate 4x4 rotation matrix around Z axis 
    function mr(a) = [ [ cos(a), -sin(a), 0, 0 ], [ sin(a), cos(a), 0, 0 ],
[ 0, 0, 1, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 0, 1 ] ]; 
    
    module tree(length, thickness, count, m = identity) { 
        color([0, 1 - (0.8 / levels * count), 0]) 
            multmatrix(m) 
                cube([thickness, length, thickness]); 
    
        if (count > 0) { 
            tree( length, thickness, count - 1, m * mt(0, length) *
mr(31.4159)); 
    
        } 
    } 
    
    tree(len, thickness, levels); 

Is it possible at all, if i cannot change the multimatrix variable, to
iterate it progressively in a loop?

You could generate the list of matrices in a recursive function first
and use the result in a for() module to generate the actual geometry.

// the identity matrix
identity = [ [ 1, 0, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 1, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 1, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 0, 1 ] ];

// generate 4x4 rotation matrix around Z axis
function mr(a) = [ [ cos(a), -sin(a), 0, 0 ], [ sin(a), cos(a), 0, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 1, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 0, 1 ] ];

// generate 4x4 translation matrix
function mt(x, y) = [ [ 1, 0, 0, x ], [ 0, 1, 0, y ], [ 0, 0, 1, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 0, 1 ] ];

function matrices(i = 10, m = identity, ret = []) = i >= 0
	? matrices(i - 1, m * mt(0, 10) * mr(20), concat(ret, [ m ]))
	: ret;

for (m = matrices(17))
  multmatrix(m)
    cube([5, 10, 5]);

Thanks, I was scratching around in the dunes of code land all day in the hope
of finding some vague mirage of of binary hope to ogle at, and suddenly this
lightning code arrives:)

It's the same kind of geometry process as used in Structuresynth.

Why do the cubes tilt on edge and can i make them tilt trough the middle?

This is an intersection() bewteen three shapes. Each shape made by extruding
along an axis. All three axes are orthogonal to each other.

Make a module which takes a list of edges (perhaps exported from inkscape)
and linear-extrude() them to form a block object based on that shape. (Using
the generate-Openscad extension)

Do this three times and rotate the objects orthogonal to each other.
make a new module which does intersection() on those three shapes

P.s. to get your messages seen on the mailing list - register. else hardly
anyone will see them..

I have a problem.   I'm used to CSG in povray where I can use a clipping
plane to throw away anything on one side of the plane.  I could cut a
cylinder on a diagonal by using a rotated plane centered at the appropriate
point. 

I am not seeing a similar functionality here.  I want a slice of a cylinder.
When I use a cube, the cube has size which throws everything off. 

Inch = 25.4 ; // define inches

MC_ID = 46 ;
Thick = 2   ; //
MC_Len = (2 * Inch); 

MC_OD = (MC_ID + (Thick*2)); 

module MainCyl () {
    cylinder(h = MC_Len, r=(MC_OD/2), center = true, $fn=200);
} // End of MainCyl

module MC_Inside () {
    cylinder(h = (MC_Len+1), r=(MC_ID/2), center = true, $fn=200);
}

module Clip(){
     cube ( size = [(MC_OD+1),(MC_OD+1),100],center = true);
}

difference (){

Would this be what you are wanting? I modified two lines, the
translation and the Z size of the cube

Inch = 25.4 ; // define inches

MC_ID = 46 ;
Thick = 2   ; //
MC_Len = (2 * Inch); 

MC_OD = (MC_ID + (Thick*2)); 

module MainCyl () {
    cylinder(h = MC_Len, r=(MC_OD/2), center = true, $fn=200);
} // End of MainCyl

module MC_Inside () {
    cylinder(h = (MC_Len+1), r=(MC_ID/2), center = true, $fn=200);
}

module Clip(){
     cube ( size = [(MC_OD+1),(MC_OD+1),200],center = true);
}

difference (){ 
    MainCyl();
    MC_Inside();
    translate ([0,0,sqrt(2)/2*MC_OD]){
        rotate ([0,45,0]) {
            Clip();

That gives the right shape, thank you!   But it doesn't scale.

I know OpenSCAD doesn't have clipping planes, I'm looking for a
replacement, even if it takes the form of a module that I could use as a
clipping plane.

Sizeless objects are powerful.

I added a # to your clip module to see the cube.
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13581/OpenSCAD_clip_001030.png> 
It shows that perhaps you need to resize the cube so it clips the entire
cylinder.
I find making the cube a large margin bigger than the diameter of the
cylinder is easiest to ensure you cut all the way through.
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13581/OpenSCAD_clip_001032.png> 
However you could just multiply the cyl size by cos/sin of suitable angles
and add Delta to ensure the cube is of a suitable dimension and is only
slightly larger than required.

module Clip(){
     #cube ( size = [(MC_OD+1),(MC_OD+1),120],center = true);
}

see this one:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:942124
Open it in customizer and see visualisation clip.
Look in code for sin/cos associated with positioning the internal filament
cut hole.

Your question is unclear. Does "I want to slice a cylinder" mean
1. "I want to cut a slice off a cylinder", or
2. "I want to cut a slice out of a cylinder", or . . .

Be that as it may, you are probably not aware that you can make shapes
transparent. In the code, I have disabled difference() and made Clip()
transparent. This way, you can see what you are doing and decide for
yourself how to adapt the code to your needs.

Inch = 25.4 ; // define inches

MC_ID = 46 ;
Thick = 2   ; //
MC_Len = (2 * Inch); 

MC_OD = (MC_ID + (Thick*2)); 

module MainCyl () {
    cylinder(h = MC_Len, r=(MC_OD/2), center = true, $fn=200);
} // End of MainCyl

module MC_Inside () {
    cylinder(h = (MC_Len+1), r=(MC_ID/2), center = true, $fn=200);
}

module Clip(){
     cube ( size = [(MC_OD+1),(MC_OD+1),100],center = true);
}

//difference (){ 
    MainCyl();
    MC_Inside();
    translate ([0,0,30]){
        rotate ([0,45,0]) {
          #  Clip();
        } // End of rotate
    } // end of translate
//}

Try the script below and change from union() to intersection() to difference() to see what you want

I was hoping it would be possible to rotate primitives over any point on
their surface, and i can just do that by translating again after the
rotation. rotation over the middle of any side would be cool.

I am just attempting this and have found that it's very steep mathematics for
an evening to adjust transformation and rotation matrices to account for
irregular rotations of cubes around the middle of the y axis of one of the
faces, i basically want rotate cubes as if they were jointed by a point in
the middle of their base.

I figure that the only logical way for me to do that is to rewrite a cube
primitive centered in the middle of a y axis face and not in the middle or
corner of the cube.

I have the same nonplanar message with the following code.

It's a 6 triangle pyramid polyhedron, any random combination of unions of
this pyramid causes the error warning. The CGAL engine still makes the
geometry fast. am wondering if it would even cause the error with a cube,
and if so why with a poly constructed cube and not a primitive one.

module tetra(size, height) {
	polyhedron ( points = [[size, 0, 0],
			[0, 0, size],
			[-size, 0, 0],
			[0, 0, -size],
			[0, height, 0]], 

	faces = [[0, 1, 2, 3],[4, 1, 0],[4, 2, 1],[4, 3, 2],[4, 0, 3]]);
}


width =4;
hgt = 2;

// the identity matrix 
identity = [ [ 1, 0, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 1, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 1, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 0, 1 ]
]; 

// generate 4x4 rotation matrix around Z axis 
function mr(a) = [ [ cos(a), -sin(a), 0, 0 ], [ sin(a), cos(a), 0, 0 ], [ 0,
0, 1, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 0, 1 ] ]; 

// generate 4x4 translation matrix 
function mt(x, y) = [ [ 1, 0, 0, x ], [ 0, 1, 0, y ], [ 0, 0, 1, 0 ], [ 0,
0, 0, 1 ] ]; 

function matrices(i = 10, m = identity, ret = []) = i >= 0 
        ? matrices(i - 1, m 
        * mt(0, width) 
        * mr(33.65)
        , concat(ret, [ m ])) 
        : ret; 

for (m = matrices(300)) 
  multmatrix(m) 
    tetra(2,4);

Your facets all have the wrong winding order. With faces = [[3, 2, 1,
0],[0, 1, 4],[1, 2, 4],[2, 3, 4],[3, 0, 4]]); the warnings go away and F6
is much faster as well.

Note that in general you might get non-planar warnings when you do
rotations if you don't split the base into two triangles. This is because
floating point inaccuracies might make the transformed vertices slightly
non-planar.

Note also all your emails go into Google's spam filter so people might not
see them. Your email address seems to be blacklisted.

You may find it useful to use center=true when defining you objects. This
will place the center of all three dimension at the coordinate origin
[0,0,0].

However the general answer to you question is:
1. Translate the cube so that the point about which you wish to rotate is at
[0,0,0].
2. Perform the rotation.
3. Translate so that the point about which you rotated is at its desired
location.

Example:
x= 5; y =8; z=10;
translate([5,-10,15]){ // move rotated object
  rotate([0,0,30]){
    translate([0,-x/2,0]){ // move rotation point to origin
      cube([x,y,z]);
} } }

note that the the pairs of braces {} are not required but are shown here for
clarity of the scope of each operation.

Oops. I had meant to use
 translate([0,-y/2,0]) not x/2 
But this shows that you can use any point location.
Even one outside the object will work.

Thanks Neon22 i will see the anandamide version.

I had a go to rotate from centre=true, it sets the rotation point at the
gravity centre of the cube.

Checked the forums for a solution, in the end i wrote a new cube primitive
that rotates ok.

I don't know structure synth very well but i have a grasp of the geometry
process as i have written a small copycat program of it enough to know some
of the iteration rules...

It would have been difficult to write the same thing in openscad without
adding multimatrix in a loop for some 1000ds of transforms, and if it's
possible then you can take the above code and create some angle behaviour
rules and sizing rules to make s-synth tentacles. The actual language of the
SS is not necessary, just to copy it's iteration process which is adding
things on top of each other and rotating them, and adding functions that
make systems of loops in a code spagetti of cubes. when making geometry with
loops it's best to have an underlying ruleset that makes the angles regular
and all the things in a sequence, the above code does that ok. 

I am having problems with the rotation matrix though, it's too good, i
realized my other program has an error that flips around over 180 and makes
spirographs and i have no idea how to recreate it in openSCAD.

When encountering this "non-planar" warning at rendering, but the shape 
looks normal, will it go print correctly? Or this warning has to be
corrected 
to make a correct print ?

I think it just resorts to splitting the face into triangles, so it doesn't
cause any problem other than being slower than triangulating it yourself.

So i have use a standard transformation matrix in openscad, which uses a
matrix processed by multimatrix.

the standard trs matrix can be rotated and placed with this:



i have to write a quaternion lookrotation function for openscad, unless
there is another option. i can export the positions and rotations to any
format from Unity3d so perhaps will use the fct's from it.

Btw., the non-planar handling was rewritten just before the 2015.03 release - please report any new issues as there still might be unhandled corner cases in that code.

Sorry for getting a brain haemmorige over such a simple error. I formatted
the array with too many [] square brackets. I am like a theatrical, clown
coder, i have noticed it's one of my coding skills. falling over very small
programming tasks and cartwheeling 20 meters into a wall before i notice it
was not a major error. sry

ok so here is a complete parser for position of unity transforms, it writes

into a scad array and csg'd there. for the moment just tested the cube
centered and it works ok.

for (var i =0; i < depth; i++){


	//obj2 = the object to get the transformation matrix from
		
		
	// takes the matrix coordinates and formats them into .scad matrix array

	var mtrs : String = "[";
	var loopcount = 0;
	var number : Matrix4x4 = obj2.transform.localToWorldMatrix;
	mtrs = mtrs + "[" ;
	for (var l =0; l < 4; l++)

Message-ID: <1440499281991-13605.post@n5.nabble.com>

I have found that some of the STL's can't be processed after Netfabb in
Meshlab because the polygons are not all welded and gaps appear if i try
subdivision. 

I am using CSG and perhaps extrusion could be easier to fix geometrically?

What are your techniques for post processing and error correction of mesh,
what programs do you use in combination with openscad?

I figure most of the STL's can go straight to a printer perhaps via netfabb,
so if i want some smoothed spirographs i should try and get them done right
in openscad and not work on them after in Meshlab?

You shouldn't need to post process files from OpenScad. Best to program
manifold objects to start with.

The best way to make smooth shapes from mathematical functions is to use
recursive functions / list comprehension to make lists of vertices and
faces to pass to polyhedron. That is fast so you can have enough facets to
make it smooth.

You do sometimes have to post-process STL files generated by OpenSCAD,
because OpenSCAD sometimes writes out bad STL (ie, files that OpenSCAD
can't itself read). You can reproduce this fairly simply, by doing CSG
operations on spheres. This was discussed in an email thread earlier this
year.

Yes anything that creates vertices too close together breaks OpenScad STL
generation, but if you don't use CSG and just form polyhedra with maths you
have complete control over whether it is a valid mesh or not.

Cases 1 and 2 can't work as they do a union of two objects like:

+----\
|     \
+------\

and

  /----+
 /     |
/------+

which results in a cube again.

One option would be to push the n loop into the difference so only
two base cubes are generated and for each one two cuts are produced:

module edgeRails1() {
  for(i = [1,-1]) {
    translate([(railDist+(midRailX+edgeX)/2)*i,0,(edgeZ+mountZ)/2]) {
      difference() {
        cube([edgeX,edgeY,edgeZ], center=true); //edge rails
        for (n = [1, -1]) {
          translate([0,edgeY/2*i*n,0]) rotate([0,0,30*n]) cube([edgeX*2, edgeChamferSize, edgeZ], center=true);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

In the end, that's essentially the same as case 3 (note that the n
loop can be removed from the first for() there too).

ciao,
  Torsten.

Hi David,

Below is a gist link to?an OpenSCAD module that will fake a clipping
plane using the cube object. It is based on POV-ray syntax. For example:




difference() { sphere(3); fakeclipplane([1,1,2],2,10); }

This will 'clip' a sphere of radius 3 using a plane with normal
vector 1,1,2 at distance '2' from origin, using a 'cube' of size 10
to fake the plane



https://gist.github.com/donbright/0ba2934c6c9b7b69c411


Please let me know if it is what you were looking for.

nop head: "Yes anything that creates vertices too close together
breaks OpenScad STL generation".

This is a bug in OpenSCAD. Generated STL files should always be valid.
At the very least, OpenSCAD should be able to read any STL file that
it generates, and that will be my criterion for fixing the bug.
Whether other programs can successfully read OpenSCAD generated STL
files is not guaranteed, since those other programs could have bugs or
limitations that we have no control over.

In the majority of cases, the problem is caused by a bug in the
export_stl() function, which throws away most of the information in
each floating point number, and only prints a crude ASCII
approximation of the number, instead of printing an accurate
representation.

In a small minority of cases, the problem is caused by the conversion
from CGAL exact rational numbers to 64 bit floating point numbers. I
expect this situation is quite rare, compared to the bug in
export_stl(), but to completely fix the problem, I think we'll need to
switch to a new geometry kernel that represents the rendered model
using 64 bit floats instead of using rationals. This new kernel will
also be a lot faster.

The bug in export_stl() is fixable, but it's complicated, so there is
a lot of reading ahead.

Here are lines containing the bug:

        output << "    outer loop\n";
        BOOST_FOREACH(const Vector3d &v, p) {
                output << "      vertex " << v[0] << " " << v[1] << "
" << v[2] << "\n";
        }
        output << "    endloop\n";

The problem lies in the use of 'output << v[i]' for outputing a
floating point number. By default, a C++ stream prints a floating
point number with a precision of '6', meaning that at most 6 decimal
digits are used to represent the number. But in this case we are
printing 64 bit floating point numbers, which have 53 bits of
mantissa. In order to print a 64 bit floating point number accurately,
that is to print the number without losing any information, up to 16
decimal digits are required. Obviously, capping the precision at 6
throws away most of the information in the floating point number.

This is actually a complex and subtle problem. There is an algorithm
for printing floating point numbers accurately. It was first described
by the paper "How to print floating-point numbers accurately" by Guy
Steele and Jon White in 1990. This algorithm determines the minimum
number of decimal digits required to uniquely characterize the
floating point number, such that it can be distinguished from
neighbouring floats. There is a sister algorithm, "How to read
floating-point numbers accurately", which reads this decimal
representation and exactly reconstructs the original 64 bit binary
float.

OpenSCAD uses boost::lexical_cast<double>(string) to convert a decimal
floating point string representation to a 64 bit double precision
float. Based on my code review of the Boost and C libraries, this
works correctly: it uses the "How to read floating-point numbers
accurately" algorithm to read the float, using David Gay's
implementation of strtod() on the platform I checked.

Unfortunately, there seems to be no function in the C or C++ standard
that prints a floating point number accurately, using the shortest
representation that works, in accordance with the algorithm. And that
means we'll need to import code from an open source library to do the
job. In theory, we might be able to solve the problem by specifying a
precision of 16, but I've experimented with that, and in many cases
you get way more than the minimum number of decimal digits required to
uniquely specify the number. This would lead to unnecessary bloating
of the size of STL files, and I don't think people will be happy with
that. So I think we need to use the algorithm.

There are several open source implementations of the algorithm on the
internet, but the most popular and trusted implementation is "dtoa" by
David Gay, so I propose to use that.
   http://www.netlib.org/fp/dtoa.c
The netlib approach to version control is very old school. Here is the
change log for dtoa.c:
   http://www.netlib.org/fp/changes
You'll note that the code is being actively maintained, and was
originally written in 1990. It takes a long time to shake all the bugs
out of an algorithm this subtle, which is why I don't trust the more
recent implementations quite as much, even though they claim to be
faster.

In order to make David Gay's dtoa work correctly on intel platforms,
it is necessary to execute the
   _control87(PC_53, MCW_PC);
instruction first, which forces the use of double precision (53 bit)
rounding precision in floating point computations. A side effect of
executing this during OpenSCAD initialization is that floating point
computations will be performed consistently on Windows and Linux
platforms, with the same results, which I do not think is the case
currently. That might be a useful change. It will probably help with
unit testing.

The bug also exists in the AMF export. In that case, the AMF standard
is very precise, and we are *required* to output 64 bit floats in
ASCII, using the "How print floating point numbers accurately"
algorithm.

I don't understand that method.

if you wished to rotate the object around its centre - y=1, once the obect
is rotate you can find where the point y-1 is relative to the new rotation
of the object, using the object's orientation vector3, and then use that
minus the same point at it's previous rotation, to translate the point to
the rotatearound position. ?!?

Added to that I think OpenScad still snaps vertices to an arbitrary grid
without topological awareness, which also causes bad meshes when vertices
are close. I may be wrong but I don't remember it being fixed.

That's just a symptom of the underlying problem.

Iterate over each point. Enter each point into a dictionary along with
its STL file value. If any two points have the same STL value then adjust
them by the smallest amount possible so they don't clash but preserve
ordering. Iterate this as needed jiggling other points so it all fits
correctly and in order.

Write out the STL using the dictionary values instead of the 'exact'
values internally used.

A fancier approach is to identify points that will resolve to the same
value and simplify the mesh, but that's way way harder geometry that
jiggling points.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Scale which varies with Z
Message-ID: <55DE663C.9080003@jonbondy.com>

You can consider the cylinder() implementation as having a scale that 
varies with Z, in that you can specify a lower radius and an upper 
radius. Unfortunately, this facility is not available with other 
primitives or with more complex objects

I would like to be able to scale a complex object so that the X and Y 
scales vary with Z.

Any ideas?

Jon

cylinder does have the option to specify the option a radius at the

beginning and at the end.

The result is effectively a cone.(or part of cone)

But with the cone, the radius changes linearily from begin to end.

Other realtions are not possible as the primitive cylinder/cone  does only

define points at the very bottom and the very top.

In implement to map nonlinear scale between bottom and top correctly, the

cylinder would have to define points all

around its surface(not done due to performance reasons)



I also wished to to define a thread of a screw by using an angular bar and

then wrap it around a cylinder

with a X - To Angle bending operation, but such operations cannot exist

due to the limited primitives.

I don't understand your problem.

OpenScad rotate() is always around the origin. So you translate your object
so the point on it you want the rotation to be around is at the origin.
Then you rotate it. That point is still on the origin. Then you translate
it back to where it used to be. The end result is that point on the object
has not moved but the object has rotated about it.

Just use old good sprintf() to specify number of digits as the first step?

Doug Moen has assigned the problem of mesh correctness to the number of
digits available for calculation / used in data storage. That is the issue
on the surface, but it cannot be the real one. The real one is that "As a
consequence of the discreteness of the number system of the computer, the
simplest laws of algebra are no longer valid on the computer" (from Peter
Henrici, Essentials of Numerical Analysis, John Wiley and Sons, 1964,
opening sentence of chapter 1.2). I substantiate this with three pages from
the book, containing examples.

When you do matrix operations like rotations, you operate on terms like
a*b-c*d, which lead to large rounding errors if a*b approximately equals
c*d, even if the individual a,b,c,d are widely different. This situation
arises e.g. if points are too close to each other (the sphere example
earlier in the thread). Rounding errors in rotations (see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation) may lead to
the unit vectors being no longer orthogonal. For my own work I restrict
myself to defining a rotation as rotate(deg_a,[x,y,z]) where either x or y
or z may take the value 1, all other are always zero, in the hope that this
leaves the unit vectors of the shape upon which rotate()  operates
orthogonal, even when the shape has been rotated many times. 
Unfortunately, as long as rounding is allowed inside the computer, such as
in floating point operations, this problem will not go away, irrespective of
how many digits are used. Double precision (64 bits) is not good enough, 
Long precision (80bits) may do the trick, which is why Intel has used Longs
for their co-processors since the 80286 (or was it 80386) processor days.
There are of course libraries for infinite precision work, but somewhere a
compromise is unavoidable . . .

ufomorace you are over thinking the problem. 

If you move your object to place the center of rotation at the origin,
rotate it, then move it back by changing the sign on the x,y,z values used
for the first move, it is right back where it was, but rotated. 

Nothing complicated about the math. 
Yes, all the other points have a new location, but that is what you wanted. 

If you now want it some where else, think about moving that center of
rotation.

If what you are trying to do is rotate your gusset to place it on a member
with a different orientation, you need to be aware that rotate() always
rotates about the origin [0,0,0].

See the tread "rotating a cube around the center of the y-axis of the cube"
for more discussion of this.

My motivation has to do with beveling the interior of a cavity.

Imagine a cube with a some-what oval cavity drilled into it.  The 
initial layers of my 3D prints are always a bit wider than the remaining 
layers, so that cavity would have a lip at the bottom, a lip that is not 
part of the 3D design.  We either have to file the lip off manually or 
create a chamfer or bevel at the bottom of the cavity.  Chamfering some 
shapes is easy (a cylinder!) but chamfering an arbitrary shape is more 
difficult.

My concept was to take the shape of the cavity and subtract it from the 
cube, but then use the scale-that-varies-with-Z to make another copy of 
that shape which was broader at the bottom and narrower at the top.  The 
hope is that if I then subtract that shape also, I will get the bevel.

I'm sure there are other ways to do this.

That is beautiful :)

The problem seems to lie in the amount of time needed to do the difference
with that enormous spherical shell.
So I put a render in a different place and tried it with the smaller value
and it came out in a minute (reduced range).

Without the render it never starts (0/1000). With the render it went 22/1000
very quickly and came back with an object in a minute.
Cheers...

The first rotate and translate look like they're in the wrong order. If the
rotate goes first then it will rotate around the origin *before* translating
to a new position. This is where you should put your overall rotate/pos
transform IMHO.
However - you need to remember that all rotates occur around the origin. So
your shapes need to be balanced either side of the origin for rotates to act
equally. I've centered some shapes below and remixed your ordering a bit.

Neon22:

Your use of render() confuses me.  The manual says

render() {
     some geometry
     }

While you just say

render();

How does that work?

I have to say that I tried to use render() at one point and simply gave 
up from confusion.  If it always renders (does an F6) for the specified 
geometry, then how does it save time?  Or does the render only occur if 
the source code in that geometry has changed since the most recent 
render?  The documentation would benefit from a better example, IMHO.

Sorry, Jon, I just don't know. I should look at the source I suppose.
My assumption is that the object gets sent to CGAL for resolving.
Therefore its cached and used in a further stage.
But I'm guessing...

Subject: [OpenSCAD] rotate_extrude with polygon touching x-axis
Message-ID: <1440829937110-13636.post@n5.nabble.com>

I just wanted to check that I am correct in assuming that rotate_extrude has
some specific logic that deals with polygons that touch the x-axis, e.g.

d=1;
p=[[d,-10],[20,-10],[20,10],[d,10]];
rotate_extrude() polygon(p);

The centre hole closes when d=0.  Is this OK, no danger of leaving a very
small hole and/or "junk" on the centre line?

Thanks.

I had lots of problems with this while working on this project.
- http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:923244
So my solution was to purposely shift the profile 0.1 off the Yaxis and then
union in a cylinder that was radius > 0.1 to fill the hole.

F6 exposed the problem and this approach fixed it.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Running OpenSCAD with Xwindows
Message-ID: <1440860416123-13639.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi,

I'm in the process of moving some of my development workover to some virtual
machines. As a consequence I am running OpenSCAD via a x-windows server
(Xming).

The VM is running Ubuntu 14.04 and I've installed OpenSCAD 2015.03-1. When
OpenSCAD is run on the Ubuntu desktop the File menu appears at the top of
the screen. From here I can export to STL.

However, when I run OpenSCAD over x-windows I don't get the top menu and the
only way I export to STL is to enable the editor pane, where there is
button. I would rather not have the editor window open as I'm using an
external editor.

Would it be possible to add or move the 'Export to STL' button to the
console pane?

Regards, Ian.

I had wondered, as you suggest, if leaving a small hole and then filling it
in with a cylinder was a safer option, particularly given that numbers are
held as floating point.

However the OpenSCAD manual does include an example that creates a solid
with no central hole:
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Using_the_2D_Subsystem#Extruding_a_Polygon  
...?

This is probably the Ubuntu bug again. Ubuntu messes with the normal menus.

Maybe the procedure from the FAQ helps to workaround the issue:

I agree it should work - and maybe it works with Zero.
But I created my curves in inkscape and exported from there and so mine all
have long floating point values. Top and Bottom are the same but FP.
So I ran into this  problem. Its quite likely (given other threads) that its
simply an FP accuracy problem and CGAL should work it perfectly.

So if you can do it with Zero as your major axis endpoint - I'm guessing
it'll probably work.

The manual is correct.

render(); is basically a null statement, render nothing. So I can't see how
it makes a difference, I doubt it does. Actually I just measured it, no
difference.

render() is usually good where some geometry either;
a. doesn't preview well, F5 sometimes has trouble with complex items, the
render() will show the geometry correctly,
b. is repeated many times, the render()'ed geometry, once cached, /may/ be
faster to paint than the CSG preview.

The other effect, is when render()'ed in preview, that cached bit does NOT
need to be re-rendered for F6, hence F6 /may/ be faster, where F5 included
render()'s.

CGAL, F6 & render(), are cached, with the values of the tree for that
geometry, so a sphere(r=10) if it occurs multiple times will have one
geometry, however if you have a for(i) loop with sphere(r=i) the different
sizes will be different cached geometry, there will be no cache performance
improvement.

Depending on the geometry, you should generally have a guess at the
convexity parameter too. Otherwise the render() can be useless.

AFAIK, yes, if the geometry parameters don't change, it doesn't render. But
not based on source code as such, but have a look at the CSG Tree (under
Design menu), if an item there has the same parameters, it only evaluates
once (in that context).

In conclusion tho, I doubt the design here benefits from render(). Each of
the 41 x 41 hex elements that form the mesh is a distinct, the polyhedron is
probably cached, but it then has to be modified 1600+ times...

@MichaelAtOz thanks for the clarity. I'm mystified then as to how the render
went from never completing ( in 10 mins) to completing in < minute for this
particular object. Clearly its not related to render() but just a
coincidence as Ive worked on the object.

My comment was based on my experience with this object and what I noticed
which was this:
- in regular F9 preview mode, if the user gets close to the underside of the
mesh where it intersects the spheres, the geo will flash in and out of
visibility.
- I believe this is due to the massive Bounding box of the difference
operator (I see this all the time if a second object in the difference is
very large compared to the first. In fact I try to make my  clipping objects
as small as reasonable to avoid this visual side effect.)
- So I "moduled" (not really a verb) the parts and then rendered
(incorrectly) the spheres, hoping that what this meant was that the tree for
this part would be cached at the module boundary and so speed up the whole
process as opposed to being recalculated 40x40 times.

My thought process is clearly wrong but its still a mystery to me as to what
I did to make it speed up. Maybe it was simply turning aspects into modules
?

Nice explanation.  If we can get content like this into the manual, I 
think it would be helpful to others.

So, just to be clear, performance improvements can be expected if
1) the same geometry is used repeatedly, since it will only need to be 
computed once; or
2) F6 can be sped up after an F5 has computed the geometry initially

For your 1) case, that is for F5, but F5 also caches (different cache)
without render(), so it depends on the geometry I think. However, with
render() the first F5 will be slower...

As a general statement. Unless something doesn't display properly - like I'm
finding for text() - in preview (F5), don't bother with render().

Another technique some people use is to export the complex bits as a STL,
import() them, as they have been rendered hence that bit doesn't need to be
rendered again (if that part of the model is stable).

...and if you notice a laggie display refresh on preview, render() can help.
Compare the display responsiveness of a non-trivial model after F5 v's F6.

BTW, your model renders, without render(), in 12m 55s on my 2.54GHz system.
It caches as it goes, so if you cancelled after 10m, then added the
render();, most of it was already cached so it just had to finish the rest.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Odd module variable assignment behavior
Message-ID: <CANe40gLrZirWgSSos5rqZ+1wyA8WKMacTWSXw=-bmxD_JvLL6A@mail.gmail.com>

I ran into something very strange when tracking down an "undefined"
variable bug in my code. It turned out to be caused by the order in which I
declared my initial variables, and changing this order unintuitively causes
later reassignments to fail.

For example, consider this minimum reproducible example:

module test()
{
    a = 1;
    b = 2;
    c = 3;
    c = a + b;
    echo("a:", a);
    echo("b:", b);
    echo("c:", c);
}


Running test() outputs the expected:


    ECHO: "a:", 1
    ECHO: "b:", 2
    ECHO: "c:", 3

However, if you flip the ordering of the variables, reassignment fails:


module test()
{
    a = 1;
    c = 3;
    b = 2;
    c = a + b;
    echo("a:", a);
    echo("b:", b);
    echo("c:", c);
}

So that running test() outputs the unexpected:



    WARNING: Ignoring unknown variable 'b'.
    ECHO: "a:", 1
    ECHO: "b:", 2
    ECHO: "c:", undef

Is this a bug? If it was simply a problem with the repeated assignment to
c, I would have expected each example to produce "undef".

Large text() can create lots of vertices, so render() can help
with display performance in some cases.

If the display looks strange, that's more likely an issue with
unknown/wrong convexity, e.g.

difference() {
	cube([30, 30, 10], center=true);
	linear_extrude(30, center=true) text("W");
}

produces lots of preview artifacts on my system.

Adding convexity=4 to the linear_extrude fixes that.

I guess it's pretty much model dependent if it's better to
just give the correct convexity or use render() to workaround
the display issue by forcing the mesh calculation.

ciao,
  Torsten.

If that doesn't work then I would try using a different window manager
on the ubuntu system, like XFCE.

Reassignments should generally be avoided, see this section of the  manual
<https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/General#Variables>  .

The error you got is because the scope of 'c' is established when it is 1st
defined, at which point 'b' does not exist. So when it is finally evaluated
it can't find 'b'. 

A variable retains the last assignment, try this;

module test()
{
    a = 1;
    echo("a:", a, "b:", b, "c:", c);
    b = 2;
    echo("a:", a, "b:", b, "c:", c);
    c = 9;
    echo("a:", a, "b:", b, "c:", c);
    c = a + b;
    echo("a:", a, "b:", b, "c:", c);
}

test();

Personally I get around these problems by always making a new variable and
never reusing one.
//
a=1;
b=2;
c=3;

useful_c = (c==3) ? a+b : c;
echo(str("useful_c = ", useful_c));

// Its always easier if you name your variables based on
//  what they do instead of this arbitrary kind of example.
// E.g.

Width = 3;
Height = 2;
Angle = 45;
$fn = 42;

rotate([0,0,Angle]) {
	mywidth = cos(Angle) * Width;
	depth = mywidth/2;
	echo(mywidth, depth, cos(Angle));
        //
	resize([mywidth,depth,1]) {
		sphere(1);
		translate([0,0,-Height])
			cylinder(r=1, h=Height);
	}
}

Ive noticed a strategy that many "Customizer" writers use which is to
Capitalise the variables you intend the user to modify, then use lower case
for internal adjusted versions of those same variables. (Caps show up nicely
in the UI).

However its generally acknowledged that just changing case like this is very
bad for readability and trying to find your bugs. But that's a completely
different flamewar...

think of module as a function definition. All you need to do, now that you've
defined the module "why", is to call it.

so:

module why() {
    sphere(20);
}

why();

In OpenSCAD, the above code is treated as:

> module test()
> {
>     a = 1;
>     
*
> c = a + b;
*
>   //<======

>     c = a + b;
> }

Imagine that OpenSCAD scans the code twice, the first time "updates" the
definition to the last one (in this case, changes c=3 to c=a+b), and the 2nd
time executes it. So when it executes, it can't find b, 'cos b hasn't
defined yet. 

So, whenever OpenSCAD tells you "Unknown variable XXX", it could be that XXX
is really not yet defined (which is easy to find), or it's some other var
that uses XXX at the time XXX not yet defined (but it won't tell you who
this some "some other var" is). 

This is a thing that can be very annoying, especially when the code grows up
to thousands of lines. But it's the nature of OpenSCAD. Just have to deal
with it.

Hi Torsten,

Thank you very much for the link.

Using QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME= openscad works.. So I will use that for now. 
I'm not comfortable with removing the appmenu-qt5 package as I'm not 
sure what other side effects there may be.

Regards, Ian

Currently there is no such thing (except implementing it manually using flags).

There is a request to add something like assert() in:

  https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/381

which is a bit awkward to implement as it would be useful to handle both
functions and modules.

It's not backwards, both modifiers overlap in visual apperance as both make the object transparent (in different colors) by default.


Highlight / Debug is the # modifier which:

- highlights / forces display in transparent red so it's visible even in difference()
- it's debug as apart from the implicitely changed visual, it's still part of the model

Transparent / Background is the % modifier which:

- makes the subtree display in transparent gray to somehow show it's "commented out for render"
- removes it ("backgrounds it"?) from the render tree completely so it's not part of the final model, it's only shown in preview mode

The main reason for the modifiers is actually not the visual appearance as this can be changed by an explicit color()


ciao,
  Torsten.

Both will display for difference.  Yes they both have transparent properties,
so I guess it somewhat a matter of semantics.
However with difference() the pink with # lets me see inside the object from
which it was subtracted, while the grey with % does not.

To me that makes the # more transparent than the %.

I discover this when I used the one labelled transparent, expecting to be
able to see inside, which I could not

Yep, that's the intention, # shows what happens for debugging purposes.

Think of % as a kind of sticky note in the model that will display but not
F6-render as it's not actually part of the model.

If you have an idea how to explain the difference between the modifiers
better, I'm happy to add that to the manual (or you can do that yourself
if you like, it's a wiki :-).

Message-ID: <1441045527681-13666.post@n5.nabble.com>

I think part of the difficulty explaining the modifiers is that no one really
knows what they should be for :)

There are two special features of the modifiers other than color() that can
not be implemented by a user "debug()" module : removing the object from the
CSG tree, and applying a color attribute which is "sticky" ie. overrides the
normal color precedence.

Personally I would like to divorce the colors from the special features, so
that the user could write their own debug modifiers. This was discussed on
github quite a bit. I can see merits for various use cases.

A syntax like color(force=true) could make the color sticky, possible
render(false) to remove from the CSG.

The difficult bit as usual is creating clean extensions and keeping it
backward compatible.

I think it would be interesting to be able to override the modifiers e.g. 

module operator% ()
{ render (false) color ("gray", 0.5) children();
}

would be a user defined equivalent of %.

I keep hitting this thread when trying to find a good example of using concat
for a particular task, which i've just figured out, so thought i'd post my
example.

I was wanting to generate a polygon given a start point, and a vector of
offset vectors.  I used the pseudo-code provided above and came up with
this:

That's handy, thanks for sharing.

Note that using 'raw text' causes that bit to not go to the mailing list,
just the forum, unless you tick the 'Message is in HTML Format' box. (bug
with Nabble IMO)

I had an issue like this in a Customizer script where users could choose
values that could make a nonsense result. Because of the lack of a feedback
or reporting loop, I chose to detect the conditoin and replace the generated
object with a text object containing a message.

So I executed normally but exposed a different object.

While I certainly appreciate the !, #, *  - I haven't personally found a use
for the %. YMMV.
I think the bases are covered and users will determine which approach works
for them.
FWIW I think the wordings OK ... Examples of how people use these values is
always useful.

Yeh, but it would be handy to have something deep in your code like 

exit("you idiot!");

Add an option to my theoretical  echof()
<https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/741>   - who's name can be just
echo() but proposed within functions. And echo() the module too of course.

echo("You idiot!", $exit=true); 
// $exit, to try to reduce backward compatibility conflict with normal
variable names.

I would prefer an exit() function, or, if we want a message a different
function like die() or fatal().

I really don't like functions/methods/subroutines with flag parameters.
