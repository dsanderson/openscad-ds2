I see, thanks for clarifying that. I hope we'll an OpenSCAD update in the
future that takes care of this.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Usage of use and include
Message-ID: <1467384908785-17850.post@n5.nabble.com>

I really have not understood the behaviour of nested use and include as
expressed in the wiki Manual. And does not understand the outcomes of the
following three codes:

> // file test1
> VAR = 1;
> function f(a) = VAR;


> // file test2.scad
> include 
> <test1.scad>
> function g(a) = f(a);


> // file test3.scad
> include 
> <test1.scad>
> use 
> <test2.scad>
> function f(a) = a*VAR;
> echo(g(5));

I would expect an output ECHO: 5 from running test3.scad. However, the
redefinition of f() in test3.scad does not override the test1.scad
definition. If, instead of use, I include test2.scad in test3.scad I get the
wanted overriding but at the expenses of an unwanted additional echo.

Message-ID: <CAMyDR6LJ9AnDWNNAmQZJ3HFM52aWO_pRPdaDj3oZHf6R+0J91A@mail.gmail.com>

Anyone know of a library and sample call to an ACME pipe fitting?
Also, standard NPT would be good too.

If I have a bolt, I can do a difference to get the female part.

I have done a cursory look at openscad libraries that come with it, I
haven't updated in a LONG time. But it is hard to make sense of what and
how to call some of it.

AFAIK

include <> basically brings the text inline to the main file. Hence global
scope/context applies.
The internals of a use<>'ed file operates in its own context.

Thus, with use<> the f(a) defining g() in test2.scad will always be the f(a)
in test2.scad
With include<> the f(a) defining g() in test2.scad will be the f(a) in
scope, i.e. the redefined one in test3.scad.

use<> has similar issues if you want to override local variables, you can't.

IMO it is better practice to utilise include<> without executable code, than
use<>.

What picture? Since when do triangles have diameters?

That is not straight forward in basic OpenSCAD.
I'd suggest you search here on 'sweep'.

Others here can usually come up with something creative...

Jerry,

The screw thread for a nut is not exactly the difference.
You need some play to be able to screw and unscrew.
check any book about threads and you will get the right info.

I guess you are able to adapt the following code to your needs. It is
straight forward, but uses itself two libraries, which you have to download. 
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n17862/ACME.png> 

use <skin.scad>       //
https://github.com/openscad/list-comprehension-demos/blob/master/skin.scad
use <naca_sweep.scad> // http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:900137

radius = 16;  // outer radius
threads = 10; // number of threads
helices = 1;  // number of windings
angle = 29;   // open angle
steps = 50;   // resolution

threading(radius, threads, helices, angle, steps); 

module threading(r, t, h, a, s)
{  // tricky: we glue two 180? pieces together to get a proper manifold
  skin(gen_dat(PI/2*h, 180, s, a));   // half screw
  rotate([0, 0, 180]) translate([0, 0, PI/2*h])
  skin(gen_dat(PI/2*h, 180, s, a));   // half screw
}

function gen_dat(h, a, steps, angle) =
    let(ang = a>360?360:a, bar = R_(180, -90, 0, Ty_(-radius+1,
vec3D(Rack(threads, angle)))))
    [for (i=[0:steps]) Tz_(i*h/steps, Rz_(i*ang/steps, bar))]; 

function Rack(n=2, angle) = 
   concat([[0, 2]], [for (i=[0:n-1], j=[0:3])
   let(t = [ [0, 1], [2*tan(angle/2), -1], [PI/2, -1], [2*tan(angle/2)+PI/2,
1]])
      [t[j][0]+i*PI, t[j][1]]], [[2*tan(angle)+PI/2+(n-1)*PI, 2]]);

Nice design. It took 9min to render with version 2015.3-2 in a Windows  PC
with a second generation i3. Are you sure, doug, of your running time?

My Mac is a 2010 Macbook Air with a core 2 duo. After rebooting, I got a
faster render time of 28 minutes (and no error messages).

My Linux machine is more recent: it has a core i5, and the render time was
5m 35s. The model looks okay, but I got 5 CGAL errors, "CGAL Cache insert
failed". I was running my own recent build.

So we can't reproduce the crash.

I should have written which version I was using. The crash occurred in
OpenSCAD-2016.04.06-x86-32 but after you both said it worked for you I tried
in the more recent OpenSCAD-2016.05.12-x86-64 and it rendered fine. Thank
you!

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Can linear extrude twist elliptically instead of
	circularly?
Message-ID: <1467528706255-17868.post@n5.nabble.com>

I created a curve using linear_extrude of a circle, with the twist parameter
and the resulting extrusion twists around an invisible cylinder. What I am
looking to do is have the extrusion twist around an elliptical cylinder. I
could scale after the linear_extrude, and while that does make the hole
elliptical, it also stretches the extrusions, which I do not want. 

As you can see here, the left shape extrudes around a cylinder - on the
right after using scale the hole becomes elliptical cylinder but the
extrusions are stretched as well.

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n17868/Capture.png> 

What is the best way to accomplish this?

If you scaled the linear_extrude with, say, [a,b,1], scale the circle
before the linear_extrude with [1/a, 1/b].

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Function / operator similar to difference() for bounds
 along path? (Shapes can slip over each other)
Message-ID: <1467578699689-17871.post@n5.nabble.com>

I'm new to OpenSCAD, so forgive my ignorance of functions and terminology. I
am trying to design a shape that will slip over another piece. So, for
instance, imagine that I'm trying to create a cube/box that can slip over a
sphere: the function I'm looking for would create successfully larger
dimples until it reached the full diameter of the subtracted sphere, but
then *would not* close in despite the sphere being "inside" the box. 

It seems to me that this might be done by translating the "clipping" shape
along a path, creating a thin difference(), projecting the negative of
*that* down the path and difference()ing that with the other elements of the
clipping shape, and then moving the clipping shape another increment. 

Is there such a function or library?

If your sphere is convex (they usually are,  but sphere here just means the
inside shape) then you can do this :

Difference ()  {
  Cube(...) ;
  Hull() {
    Sphere(...) ;
    Translate (where to slip to) sphere(...) ;
  }
}

If you replace sphere() with a concave shape (e.g. a star) then hull will
not work as expected. Instead you may replace the hull(){...} section with
a hacked Minkowski. This will always slip the star up, rotate the cylinder
if you must change this.

Minkowski () {
Star(...) ;
Cylinder(h=slip distance, d=0.00001);
}

Thanks.

If you mean like this cross section:
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n17875/td17874.jpg> 

This does it:

difference() {
	cylinder (h = 16, r=8, $fn=100);
	translate([0,0,-0.1]) 
		cylinder(h = 16, r1 = 6.45, r2 = 5.425,$fn=4);
}

When you create a DXF file of a circle in OpenSCAD the line segments are
arranged in the correct order in a anti-clockwise direction, so why would
the the cutter be "jumping" between non adjacent line segments?

Will the laser cutter software interpret (and cut) a DXF LWPOLYLINE entity
correctly?

True, the line segments are arranged in the correct order. I don't know why
it jumps up and down, I just know that it does. I can only speculate that
the driver (CorelDraw) mixes up the file before sending it to the laser
cutter. The laser cutter is not mine, it's in a FabLab, so I don't have the
opportunaty to analyse what is happening (I pay per hour). However this
morning I discovered that a very simple "trick" eliminates my problem. When
select all objects and use the group command in CorelDraw all objects become
one and printed without problem.

About the DXF LWPOLYLINE. This solution was based on a older discussion
(https://github.com/openscad/openscad/pull/448). Since I create my dxf files
with OpenSCAD I didn't had the opportunaty to test POLYLINE and with the
group command I probably don't need to test it anymore.

Be aware that if those sizes are in mm you'll never be able to get that
precision with 3d printing (FDM). One decimal place is more reasonable.

OpenSCAD can't import SVGs however it can import DXFs. OpenSCAD from the
command line should be able to process 1000 files with a shell script.

I'm no wizard at OpenSCAD and frequently struggle with what I would expect
others might consider simple coding, but what you're asking is very
straight-forward. I've performed a similar task a few times, but not one
thousand times !

There's a useful utility in the form of a plugin for Inkscape:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:25036
it's called image to openscad or path to openscad or something like that.

If you convert your SVG files to DXF, you may find that smooth curves are
now somewhat blocky segments.

You may find that the ability of OpenSCAD to accept scripting will

We do have a development branch (not really up to date though)
that can import SVG.

This should be able to import sane SVGs with closed path polygons
easily, although with SVG being more an image than a CAD format,
the devil is in the details.

For that amount of files/models, this might be worth a try.

ciao,
  Torsten.

There is an improved version of that inkscape to openscad converter here:
- http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1065500
Supports lines and closed shapes as well as nesting.
Puts the polygons in their own variables for easy reuse.

That doesn't seem to work. Try changing a = 4 and b = 1:

a = 4; 
b = 1; 
scale([a,b,1]) linear_extrude(40, twist=360) translate([2*a,0])
scale([1/a,1/b]) circle(5);

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n17885/Capture.png> 

The extrusion is not circular.

Not at the moment. There has been some suggestions which may get implemented
in the future.
ATM, the current version 2015.03 has a View/View-all command to show the
entire object, and you can use the scale markers to get an idea of how much
you need to translate().

If you mean you want the wires to be constant width but the spiral to be
compressed sideways then linear extrude is probably not going to help.

You may get what you want by creating segment by segment. Translate 2 very
short cylinders (h=0.001) to their positions and hull() them together.
Place these segments in a for loop and you should be good.

I checked it now. You are right, it does not work. But this do it with a
lot more working time:

a = 4;
b = 1;
c = 10;
minkowski(){
    scale([a,b,1]) linear_extrude(40, twist=360) translate([c,0])
circle(0.0001);
    cylinder(r=5,h=0.0001);
}

The module translational_sweep requires that the section be convex. The
following version accepts closed paths and non-convex sections. It does not
use hull() and minkowski is needed just for horizontal segments in the path.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] construction concept for internal structural supports
	request
Message-ID: <1467916896904-17894.post@n5.nabble.com>

I'm building a vacuum manifold of sorts. It's clearly a vacuum device, as it
will be connected to my shop vac. It probably is a manifold, as it will
"distribute" the vacuum from the hose to the edge of a US sized 1x2 piece of
lumber with holes drilled in suitable locations.

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n17894/vacuum_manifold.png> 

As this will be printed on a 3d printer, I'd like to do without
3d-printer-related supports as much as possible. No supports is my primary
goal. I believe the design as presented would print well enough, once I
taper the hose cylinder at the top. Its bottom edge is a horizontal surface,
but doesn't have to be and I should be able to "difference-cone" a taper
that will preclude the need of printer-related support in that area. When
sliced, those particular supports extend the entire height and would be a
pain to remove.

On to the crux of the biscuit.

Because my shop vac really sucks, I expect that the walls would be prone to
collapse, perhaps to destruction. I plan to add a single layer of
light-weight fiberglass and epoxy resin to make the structure air-tight and
perhaps improve the strength, but internal structural supports would
certainly improve my chances.

Even though I am what I consider a sloppy code-writer, having no real
training in this practice, I've learned to generate reasonably clean
understandable code for this model. Everything is as parametric as I can get
it and I'd like to keep it that way.

The model is constructed by generating a flat plane base of appropriate
dimensions at z = 0 and a second cross-section at the correct height to
clear the obstacle created by the device for this this is being built. Using
hull() provides a clean transition and a pleasing shape, in my opinion. I've
confirmed the clearance by adding an intermediate "bulkhead" of the
obstruction and the resulting shape is within that bulkhead, so it's been
removed from the code and can be considered insignificant.

The hollow interior is generated in a similar manner. Using reduced size
bulkheads in the same locations, the hull() shape is differenced from the
primary shape. I'm satisfied with the result and wish to build on that.

I have to consider that the printer will be placing layers in the
orientation shown in the model, and avoid bridging. It's acceptable to have
vanes extending upward from z = 0 with reasonable spacing along the y axis,
but I've been unable to create code in my alleged mind that will limit the
height of the vanes to allow airflow bypass as the vanes near the upper
edge.

The difference() portion could be used as a sub-foundation, I believe,
removing material from that module. Everywhere something is removed would
result in something being generated within the manifold. Even with that in
mind, I'm unable to create suitable shapes to prevent bridging or the need
for 3d-printer-support structures.



I expect that some may consider the above code to be simplistic, but I don't
handle the complex options of loops and the like that are available within
OpenSCAD. Perhaps that's why I'm unable to create a concept for internal
printable structural supports. 

The supports could be ordinary posts, but would have to have tapers or
curvature in the vertical direction in order to avoid the printer-generated
support aspect. If the supports are vanes, I'd like to have a graduated
taper of the profile as they near the apex of the model. That is to say, the
vanes in the center should be farther away from the top edge of the model,
allowing for more air to reach the outer vanes, which will have gradually
reduced gaps from the top edge of the model, relative to the horizontal
position of the vanes.

I've been able to create a base of baffles:

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n17894/baffles.png> 



It's not much, almost nothing and I run into a bind when I try to limit the
extension. I realized later during this project that the baffles also do not
get larger in the y direction in order to encompass the manifold y increase
as it "climbs" toward the cylinder at the top.

>From the perspective of understanding the OpenSCAD code, I feel that the
baffles option has the best chance. It's also possible that if someone can
help me understand the algorithms or concepts involved in making the baffles
work, I might be able to understand the method needed to create tapered
posts within the manifold.

I'm hopeful that the code gurus on the list will be able to point me in the
right direction. If it's possible to not-write the code for me, that would
be great. I may be too dense to have that aspect work, however.

thanks
fred

If I understand your problem well, you are interested to keep the walls
distanced by guide vanes, that don't disturb the airflow. The key approach
to add vanes into a complex hollow shape is to difference them from the
interior *before* you difference the interior from the primary shape. See
this code example: 


> difference(){  cylinder(30, 50, 30, center = true);    core(); }
> 
> module core()
> {
>   difference()
>   {
>     cylinder(30.01, 48, 28, center = true);  
>     cube([100, 1, 100], center = true); 
>     translate([0, 20, 0])    rotate([20, 0, 0])    cube([100, 1, 100],
> center = true); 
>   }
> }

Your understanding is correct, although I can accept some disturbance in the
airflow, but no obstruction. The solution you present is fairly close to my
objective.

Unfortunately, the primary shape is created with hull() and does not lend
well to configuring vanes within the design constraints.

The vanes in your design extend from z = 0 to the top of the model,
relatively speaking. I believe I could create similar vanes in my design,
but they must halt before the module top in order to provide appropriate
airflow inside the perimeter of the upper module.

I'd like to keep these additions in parametric form as well, in order to
better adapt the design for my own errors in measurement.

Taking some features of your design into consideration, I may create a
second inner module with correct corresponding x and y values, while
reducing the z value in some manner. I may be able to then "inject" vanes
with step-varied rotation and spacing to provide the desired airflow.

thanks for the suggestion.

I kept the example as simple as possible to give you the idea. Of course you
are free to size, translate and rotate your vanes along your needs.
Difference() also operates over a hulled shape.

Once you let go of the OpenSCAD infrastructure and require a C++ library 
API, carve is also an alternative

I was just looking at this problem myself. My starting point was 
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1481
<http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1481>   which wraps 3 copies of an image
around a cylinder, then extrudes. There's about 15KB of Python source that
generates an OpenSCAD file. License on this is "Creative Commons -
Attribution - Non-Commercial". The author is Philipp Tiefenbacher
(wizard23). I've refactored his code a little, and extended it to include
conic surfaces, without really understanding how the underlying stuff
works.I haven't finished my tidy-up yet, but I'm happy to share (now or when
finished) as per Philipp's license. I'm new to openSCAD & Python (but a
long-time programmer) so my "tidy" may be less than your "tidy". I'm equally
happy for someone else to finish this off.If all you're interested in is
mapping text characters to a cylinder, then
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1661993 is useful.Frank

Just getting back into 3d printing so I am starting to use openscad again.
Seem much more responsive on f6 even on my 1.3 ghz I3 sandybridge dual core.
Has multithreading been included in these later builds?
Also has support for the pi2 & pi3 and there video implementation been
improved, might be useful for a design/ steering of an independent 3d
printer. A pi3 with keyboard mouse small hdmi monitor or tv hookup with a
printer could be a one stop solution if openscad won't take 24 hours to
finish a model lol

Improved how? It seems to be possible to run OpenSCAD on raspi
now, even though we don't support OpenGL ES, so this might have
happened due to changes in Mesa providing Desktop GL Surfaces.

Running the design software on the printer raspi is unlikely to
be a very satisfying solution. It might work for simple models.

  Torsten.

When I need to wrap a shape around a cylinder, I cut it in small pieces that
I reassemble on the cylinder.
The shape (here in orange) can be anything close to flat.

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n17908/wrap2.wrap2> 

Here is the code:

w=30; // radius of cylinder
h=100; // height of cylinder

//
// the pattern should be at [w,0,0] and move in y according to a
// pattern should be 2Pi * w size in Y
// Some rings...
//
module pattern0(a=0) {
    for(i=[0:3]) {
        translate([w,a*PI/180*w+i*PI/2*w+w,-20])
        rotate([-90,0,-90])
        difference() {
            cylinder(d1=PI/2*w+3,d2=0,h=80);
            translate([0,0,-0.1]) cylinder(d1=PI/2*w-3,d2=45+50,h=80);
        }
    }
}
// some text...
module pattern1(a=0) {
    translate([w,a*PI/180*w,10])
    rotate([90,0,90])
    linear_extrude(height=5,convexity=2) text("bonjour!",32);
}

// rings and text...
module pattern2(a=0) {
    pattern0(a);
    pattern1(a);
}


module cutter(a=5,w=50,h=100) {
    render()
    intersection() {
        rotate([0,0,-a/2]) translate([0,0,-h/2]) cube([w,50,h]);
        rotate([0,0,a/2]) translate([0,-50,-h/2]) cube([w,50,h]);
    }
}

%cylinder(r=w,h=h,center=true);

color("orange") translate([0,0,0]) pattern2(0);

step=5;
for( i=[0:step:360+2*step] ) {
    rotate([0,0,i])
    intersection() {
        pattern2(-i);
        cutter(step,w+20,h+20);
    }
}

Subject: [OpenSCAD] recuring windows message openscad.exe has stopped working
Message-ID: <1468274126850-17909.post@n5.nabble.com>

I've searched all over the internet but can't find an answer to this. For the
last few days, I can no longer use OpenScad although it has been running
fine for about 10 months. I'm running windows 7 home premium. When I launch
OpenScad, after about 1 or 2 minutes I get a window pop up saying  that
OpenScad.exe has stopped working. This happens even if all I do is sit there
with the welcome screen open.i.e. it doesn't matter what file I open or even
if I don't open any file at all. I've tried uninstalling and re installing
OpenScad from Windows control panel but that doesn't help. It is
coincidental with me uninstalling an inkjet printer and installing a laser
jet but I can't think why that would have any bearing on this issue. It is
the latest version of OpenScad (2015.03-2). Please help.

Hi,

Does the Windows Event Viewer show any more information related to this?

Hi Marius,

Sorry but you are dealing with a 60 something year old who does his best to
keep up with technology. I had to google Windows Event Viewer. I'm not sure
what I'm looking at but under Windows Logs, Application I found an error.
I've copied and pasted the info below.

Does any of that help?

Hi, try to stop your antivirus for a couple of minutes and run OpenSCAD. I
had a similar problem 5 or 6 monthes ago after a bunch of windows updates. I
had to exclude the openscad dir from antivirus scanning. I was then using
Avast. I'm also using Windows 7 Home Premium. Check the task manager if
there are more than one OpenSCAD process open.
Try to install a newer version of openscad. There are newer OpenSCAD
versions although not official releases.

Thanks Ian,

That helps. Could you do one more thing?
In OpenSCAD: Help menu -> Library Info -> Details.
Could you copy & paste all that info?

I think you problem is related to bugs in your graphics card driver. You may want to see if there?s a newer version available here: https://support.amd.com/en-us/download

The Library Info stuff would basically confirm this and possibly help us giving you better directions for fixing it.

Many thanks for taking the time. I turned off real time virus scanning (I
have McAfee total protection) but unfortunately that hasn't helped. I also
checked task manager and there was only one instance of OpenScad running
(well, open but not responding). If I manage to find a newer version, do I
just install it over the existing one or should I uninstal the existing
version first? On the subject of uninstalling, in "Control Panel - Programs
and features - Uninstal or change a program", next to OpenScad it has
(remove only). When I uninstall it, and check details, it just seems to
delete a bunch of files and folders. Is that significant? Thanks again.
Please keep the suggestions coming.

Hi,

Sorry if this has already been mentioned.
The example below works fine with 2016.03.26. It makes the latest 
version quit on Preview and Render.
I've hesitated to attach the problem report, thinking that you might 
prefer to reproduce it.

Benjamin


//--------------------------------------------
$fn=12;

hull() {
cylinder(r=1, h=6, center=true);
     translate([6, 0, 0])
cylinder(r=1, h=6, center=true);
}
//--------------------------------------------

It can be reduced to:
hull() {
     cylinder();
}

Hi Benjamin,

Thanks for reporting; development snapshots do have the occasional weird behavior.
This does, however, work for me, so some more info would be very helpful.

I assume it actually crashes, not just quits. Are you able to find a crash log in the console (Console.app) ?

I suspect this to be related to running on a relatively old version of OS X. We do support 10.9, we just don?t have regular tests running in that environment. If you can provide a crash log, it would be easier for me to dig into it.

 -Marius

Thanks,

I?m not sure what?s going on. Here?s the story so far:
o It crashes in the AMD OpenGL drivers
o You do have the latest stable drivers from AMD

An OpenGL driver should never crash. This is almost always a bug in the drivers, and the solution is usually to update the drivers. This doesn?t really help you though.

If you?re willing to dig deeper, here are some suggestions, in order of increasing disruptiveness:
1) Test a development snapshot of OpenSCAD (currently 2016.05.12): http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html#snapshots
2) Test using the ?Crimson? edition of the AMD drivers: https://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop/legacy?product=legacy3&os=Windows+7+-+64
3) Do a clean reinstall of any graphics- or motherboard-related software on your computer.
4) A clean Windows reinstall might also help, but that?s a bit disruptive

 -Marius

Thx,

We did make some changes in the latest snapshot, most notably discontinuing support for 10.7. It could be that we accidentally broke 10.9 support.
I?ll see if I can dig up a 10.9 VM to test with.

Hi Marius,

I tried 1) OpenScad 2106.05.12. which hasn't helped.
I'm not sure that I want to try option2. I do a lot of video editing and
don't want to upset the software that I use for that as well.
3 and 4 are not options that I'd consider. The PC is a few years old. It
started life as Acer something or other but I've since added a graphics
card, upgraded memory, changed the HDD to an SSD, added a second monitor ,
etc. The motherboard is standard Acer but no longer supported. The PC came
with Windows 7 pre-installed and I don't have a disc to start over.

Ian

Message-ID: <1468480864459-17924.post@n5.nabble.com>

Do you want issues re autocomplete as a Git Issue, just report here?

Running 2016.06.08 (git 36aac58) 

Just typed 'if t' then continued typing '<45', pressed F5 had an error tan
undefined.
Redid it and tan was in the pop-up, when I typed '<' it autocompleted.
I doubt that is intended?

The good news is that OpenScad now works fine on my PC but it gets even
more weird. Yesterday I encountered another problem in that my PC would not
boot. It turned out that the HDD boot order in Bios had been changed so it
was looking at an attached USB instead of my main SSD as the boot device. I
changed this back to as it should be in the Bios and ever since then,
OpenScad has been working fine. I really don't understand what's been going
on and can only assume that
either uninstalling the old printer or installing the new one is what
screwed things up.

Now that you have things working properly, you might want to think about
doing a system backuup.

Very sound advice which I have followed. I always backup data but have been
remiss about backing up system files. I have now made an image file and
also created a repair disc.

It must be something with a stl file I am importing.

It usually is a bad STL.
You can check it with  Netfabb Studio Basic
<https://www.netfabb.com/products/netfabb-basic>  , put it thru their 
online repair <https://netfabb.azurewebsites.net/>  , or post the STL here
and I'll take a look.
Sometimes they are repairable.

otherwise the *least number of fragments to satisfy EITHER $fn OR $fa*.

Jerry:

FWIW I just spent quite a while trying various methods to resolve this well 
known and oft discussed subject. I had used inkscape to generate a fairly 
complex lattice and used the "inkscape to openscad" extension to export a file 
to be used in OpenSCAD. That file could be used to generate a stl file with 
OpenSCAD but when I tried to then import it back into OpenSCAD it failed with 
errors similar to yours.

Lots of trial and error netted no joy. To my surprise, however, while fooling 
around, I imported the stl into blender (2.69. it has some nice tools for 
analyzing stl). I didn't "fix"/change anything and at the end I luckily made 
the mistake of exporting it as stl and when I imported it back into OpenSCAD
it worked!

Tried it on two or three other items I had done similarly and had similar 
results. Doubt if it's a fix for everything but you might want to give it a 
try.

Other words, given that both conditions yield more than 5 fragments:

- Fragments will never be less than $fa degrees, no matter how large the
circle.

- Fragments will never be shorter that $fs, no matter how small the circle.

I guess if would be interesting if that function could be exposed to the
openscad language, so we would be able to override it should we feel the
need to.

	output

Welcome to the forum.

When you render (F6) it looks normal, and the exported object will be OK -
baring other problems ;)

F5 preview uses an approximation of the geometry using tricks that provide a
quick view, what you see is called  z-fighting
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-fighting>  . As you can read in the link it
is caused by co-incident faces.

You already worked out how to fix it, basically make the object you are
removing a smidgen larger than the main object. 

Many people end up using a variable, e or epsilon (maths - an arbitrarily
small positive quantity) with a small value like 0.1 [you may need to change
it if you have very large or small designs], like so;

e=0.1;
h=20;
d=10;
size=h;
difference() {
  cube(size);
  translate([0,0,-e])
    cylinder(h=h+2*e,d=d);
}


I use s=0.05 - for smidgen, and s2=s*2, then  do like so;
difference() {
  cube(size);
  translate([0,0,-s])
    cylinder(h=h+s2,d=d);
}

You will have other issues sometimes when you have co-incident faces
elsewhere, so it is good to have two objects offset by a smidgen, like if
you put a cylinder just touching a cube surface, it is better to 'embed' the
cylinder into the cube by, like 0.01.

Thank you so much. Glad to know that it is not my install or my machine's
problem. Yes, I ended up trying to use the 0.1 as the epsilon for canceling
the regions. I didn't know I have to "embed" my object as well. It is nice
to know that. Thank you so much for your help.

You just set $fn to however you want to calculate it. You can read $fa $fs
variables (& $fn) just like normal variables.

That works, but you have to do it for every single circle because you can
not read radius.

Or I can create new modules, mycircle, mycylinder, mysphere, and do the
math any way I want. Yeah, this will work.

Thanks.

Here's the image, and the variables are as follows
height = 0.02; base_depth = 1.0; width = 62; length = 78.8;
 I know it's quite large at 620x788 but the thing that puzzled me is the
huge increase in processing time by the addition of a simple cube. I tried
running this on a couple of different computers and had the same problem.

Looks like a bug. As soon as CGAL gets involved.

Even this crashes eventually, consumes all memory;

surface("smiley.png",invert=false,center=true); // smiley.png from the wiki
of surface()
cube(1);

Not the entire rack, but I did the math for a rack rail a long time
ago and put it up on Thingiverse.

http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2983

Caveat: Somone recently pointed out to me that I somehow managed to
post broken code - you'll need to add an "include" at the top.  I'll
post an update when I get a chance.

Feel free to work with it as a starting point.  I wrote it 6 years ago
when i was first learning the language, so there's lots of room for
improvement.

Welcome to the forum. Your post is still flagged as "This post has NOT been
accepted by the mailing list yet", so nobody gets it unless they look. 
You need to subscribe to the  mailing list
<http://forum.openscad.org/mailing_list/MailingListOptions.jtp?forum=1>  ,
and respond to the registration email.

Your problem is that rands() "Generates a constant vector of pseudo random
numbers, much like an array." as you can see in the echo output in the
console;

Compiling design (CSG Tree generation)...
ECHO: [1.40732], [11.5499], [10.913]
Compiling design (CSG Products generation)...

the [...] means it is a vector (aka array), cube() does not take vectors, so
it ignores them (yes bad feature - may be fixed in the future), default
input to cube() is 1, hence the 1x1x1 cube resulting.

You could either get the first element when you call rand(), like so;

// get a single number
single_rand = rands(0,10,1)[0];
echo(single_rand);


or extract it when used in cube(), like so;

echo (book_wid[0],book_ht[0],book_dep[0]);
cube([book_wid[0],book_ht[0],book_dep][0]); 

I think the former is better.

Message-ID: <1469328930081-17958.post@n5.nabble.com>

This is my first day actually modeling my custom shape.  It is more complex
than the following example Test, but F5 looked fine and F6 would get
"WARNING: Object may not be a valid 2-manifold and may need repair!"

So I found this https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/1023 as well as
this forum's topic from sukrit_gupta.

I then tested the following and got the same error.
//Begin Test
l = 1;
w = 2;
h = 3;

points = [
    [0,0,0],
    [l,0,0],
    [l,w,0],
    [0,w,0],
    [0,0,h],
    [l,0,h],
    [l,w,h],
    [0,w,h],
];

faces = [
    [0,1,2,3],
    [0,1,5,4],
    [1,2,6,5],
    [2,3,7,6],
    [3,0,4,7],
    [4,5,6,7]
];

polyhedron(points, faces);

cube([3,2,1]);
//End Test

The polyhedron by itself is fine with F5 and F6; and the cube by itself is
fine with F5 and F6.  Together as above, F5 is fine but F6 gets "WARNING:
Object may not be a valid 2-manifold and may need repair!" and then all that
can be seen is the cube and face [4,5,6,7].  I asterisked one then the other
and also  commented each out before preparing this post.  Then F6 claimed to
be correct, but only the cube and the face [4,5,6,7] is visible.  Then I
went back to my complex code and F6 was also not complaining, but visually
it looks wrong.

Since this is a polyhedron and a cube, I don't see how to apply the github
solution.

My concern with the complex model was just touching faces of 2 different
objects.  If I add translate before the cube:
translate([1,0,0])
cube([3,2,1]);
F5 looks fine and F6 has no errors, but visually F6 shows the cube and two
faces [0,1,2,3] and [4,5,6,7].

This page actually got me modeling my custom shape
http://www.tridimake.com/2014/09/how-to-use-openscad-tricks-and-tips-to.html
and there is a warning about "The danger of CSG subtraction: dreaded
undefined surfaces!" so I was concerned about faces just touching, but I'm
not doing any subtraction and the test overlaps two objects.

What am I doing wrong?
Also is there an md5 checksum I can do on my download to at least check that
the download was fine?

Thanks.

Your polygon has most faces flipped (the vertices have wrong winding order).

Wow!  I was totally inconsistent with that.  Thanks.  I thought I was doing
all outward normals.

I got lax when I read "prefers".  Maybe that should be "requires", (higher
up on the polyhedron documentation) even though I still blew it?

"OpenSCAD */requires/ clockwise* when looking at each face from outside
inwards."

I jumped in before reading the debugging instructions.

This test case is fixed and so is my more complex model.  Thanks again for
the quick reply to my newbie mistake.

No. See the Variables bit of the  wiki
<https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/General#Values_and_Data_Types> 
.
You could generate a vector of rands() then use a for() loop to step through
it, using it to translate() to the next book.

I guess you want something like a cumulative sum to work out the start points
of each book:

// Maximum shelf length in mm
max_shelf_len = 40;
// Maximum shelf height
max_shelf_ht = 14;
// Maximum shelf depth
max_shelf_dep = 13;
// Minimum shelf depth
min_shelf_dep = 6;
// Minimum book height
min_book_ht = 7;
// Minimum book width in 0.1 mm
min_book_wid = 0.6;
// Maximum book width
max_book_wid = 2;
// Starting X point (should be zero)
shelf_len_x = 0;

function cumSum(x,offset=0,pos=0,sum=0,res=[]) =
	(pos == len(x)) ? res :
		cumSum(x, offset=offset, pos=pos+1, 
            sum=sum+offset+x[pos], res=concat(res,sum));
            
num_books = max_shelf_len / max_book_wid;
book_wid = rands(min_book_wid,max_book_wid,num_books);
book_ht = rands(min_book_ht,max_shelf_ht,num_books);
book_dep = rands(min_shelf_dep,max_shelf_dep,num_books);
book_starts = cumSum(book_wid,offset=1);

for(i=[0:len(book_wid)]){
    translate([shelf_len_x+book_starts[i],0,0])
        cube([book_wid[i],book_ht[i],book_dep[i]]); 
}

David Eccles, that is really close to what I was looking for. However, I was
hoping to have the "books" stacked next to each other like on a library
shelf. Looking at the code you wrote, I might be way out of my league on
attempting something like this.

Try this, it should be easier to understand:

// create list
FirstList=[for (i=[0:1:6]) i];
LastOne=FirstList[len(FirstList)-1];
echo(len(FirstList),LastOne);

// sum up all elements in list
AddUp=[for (i=[1:1:len(FirstList)-1]) FirstList[i-1]+FirstList[i]];
Sum=AddUp[len(AddUp)-1];
echo(AddUp,Sum);

Can you explain what you mean by "stacked next to each other"? Most normal
bookshelves don't have books of such varying sizes right next to each other,
so it's difficult for me to work out what the right thing to do should be.

The code I wrote had an "offset", which can be set to zero in order to have
the books touching each other.

It looks a bit better setting the offset to a smaller value (e.g. 0.2), and
swapping the height and depth:

book_starts = cumSum(book_wid,offset=0.2);

for(i=[0:len(book_wid)]){
    translate([shelf_len_x+book_starts[i],0,0])
        cube([book_wid[i],book_dep[i],book_ht[i]]);
}

Don't feel alone, my first programming was on an Apple II.
I'm not sure this is what you want, but here is some code that may get you
close to your goal.  
change the line that says off=a*2.3 to off=a*1.5 (or lower) to reduce space
between books  
    
module book(x=1,y=1,z=1)
   { cube([x,y,z]);}

  for (a =[0:40])
  {       
    xrn = rands(1,3,1)[0];
    yrn = rands(5,10,1)[0];
    zrn = rands(6,12,1)[0];      
    // change off to lower value to reduce space between books  
      off=a*2.3; 
      translate([off,0,0])   
      book(xrn,yrn,zrn);

I have been printing parts that were designed to have vertical walls, 
but the walls are not vertical.  I looked at the layers as generated by 
my slicer, and the vertical walls were moving from layer to layer.  I 
tried a different slicer, with the same results. This is all explained 
better in the OpenSCAD source file.

I have attached the SCAD file as well as the generated STL file: I hope 
they make it.  Any thoughts?  I'm using 2015-3-2 on Windows 10.

Netfabb says it is 10.8mm wide which is as you specified.

Adding 
color("blue",0.4) {
translate([-ar,-0.25,-0.5]) cube([ar*2,0.5,1]);
translate([-ar,-0.25,20-0.5]) cube([ar*2,0.5,1]);

Then using Netfabb rulers;

means you have problems with your slicers...

I tried the stl file with Slic3r and all layers of vertical walls are
equal. I used Repetier with parallel projection. Are you sure you are not
visualizing it with perspective projection?

And there you have it.  Perspective projection.

This still leaves me with prints that are wrong, but at least now I can 
view things correctly (thank you!).  I now have NO idea why the prints 
are as they are.

Thanks again

Jon

Tends to be a slipping coupling, pully or belt, if you print at slow speeds
it is reduced; the jerk at high speeds shows it up.

This would be good advice ... except that my machine uses lead screws on 
all axes.  I will ponder further.  Thanks!

Could be cumulative error due to a slight difference in step/mm calibration.

Thanks for the thought, but in fact the remainder of the print is 
pristine, so that is not the problem.

How exactly are your prints not vertical? Are they slanted, growing bigger
at each layer? Or what?

No pulleys.  Lead screws.  But thanks for the thought.

One small portion of the print has a vertical surface that is at a 
slight angle.  The result is that a part that is supposed to mate with 
it fails to mate.  The rest of the print is pristine.

I checked the stl file again with Repetier and there is no flaws like you
mentioned. I would suggest you to print it again in another table position.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] multmatrix() argument
Message-ID: <1469487779953-17983.post@n5.nabble.com>

OpenSCAD language has a rare leniency with programming errors. That is nice
but dangerous if the its behavior is not properly documented. I found by
mistake that multmatrix() accepts 3x3 matrix as well. And do the expected
linear transform. So, if R is a 3x3 rotation matrix, multmatrix(R) cube()
will rotate correctly the cube. More than that, it accepts even non-uniform
"matrices" like:

M = [ [ [ -1, 0, 0, 0], [0] , [0,0,-1] ];

to do a 90 degree rotation about y axis. It seems that multmatrix() fill out
the blanks with the corresponding 0's and 1's borrowed from the identity
matrix in this case. Who knows?

Although this last example is a bit odd, it would be nice to allow the use
of 3x3 matrices in multmatrix() as a feature and not just as a complacent
work around. But this should be documented to become a feature. Otherwise we
cannot rely on it.

Nice catch. I read somewhere --- not specefically for OpenScad but as a
general description --- that feeding multmatrix with a 3x3 is much faster
than with a 4x4. So if OpenScad does follow that behavior, it'd be nice to
have 3x3 for multmatrix as a regular argument when 4x4 is not needed.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] OpenSCAD working folder
Message-ID: <1469559513915-17987.post@n5.nabble.com>

At least in Windows environment, OpenSCAD system creates a folder in user
Documents area, naming it OpenSCAD with a backup folder in it. That seems to
be an great place to store all our personal OpenSCAD projects. However, when
we create a new file and try to save it, the system drive us to the
installation folder of OpenSCAD. I don't believe this is a good choice
mainly in a multi-user environment. Is there any hidden good reason for
that? Or did I miss some configuration option?

OpenSCAD will work fine with either CW or CCW, just don't* /mix/* them in the
same polyhedron

We are trying to get a quote for injection molding of a part.  We were

We received your request for quote, but we cannot process an STL-based 
or mesh file. We require surface model files, generated directly from a 
native CAD format. Saving a part in STL format deletes some of the 
information that we require. We can work with the following file 
formats: native SolidWorks (.sldprt) and ProE (.prt) files; files from 
other CAD systems output in IGES (.igs), STEP (.stp), Parasolid (.x_t or 
.x_b), ACIS (.sat); and AutoCAD (.ipt and .dwg, 3D only).

As I have SolidWorks, I searched and found a set of simple instructions to
accomplish your task. SW will import an STL file which is converted to solid
body during the import process. From there, it's a simple matter to either
save it as the .SLDPRT format or any other supported type. 

I also found during this search a set of similar steps to be performed using
FreeCAD, which one might consider if the output format of that program meets
your requirements.

If you seen Blender or Meshmixer displays of a part, you'd easily recognize
the SW conversion, although I suspect the triangles of SW, Blender and
Meshmixer are mostly ignored by the vendor for your application.

My best luck with getting STEP files from OpenSCAD is to first import 
the SCAD file into FreeCAD and then export to STEP. Note that FreeCAD 
does not support some features of OpenSCAD, and that it often takes a 
fair bit of work to get things working right with FreeCAD.

 From my experience:

 1. You absolutely cannot use these modules: offset, minkowski, hull or
    projection find another way to model things if you do.
 2. Try to do as much as possible in 2d and then extrude into 3d. This
    is better for native OpenSCAD work as well, as it's faster and
    doesn't have issues with tolerances. For example, instead of
    difference() { cube([10,10,10]); translate([2,2,-.5])
    cube([6,6,11]); } do linear_extrude(10) difference() {
    square([10,10]); translate([2,2]) square([6,6]); }
 3. Start slowly with your exporting and importing into FreeCAD. Do it
    one part or module at a time, starting with something simple that
    works. If you have many parts, export them one at a time, starting
    with the simple ones.
 4. FreeCAD can take a very long time to import an OpenSCAD model. Don't
    assume that it has crashed just because it takes 10 minutes with no
    progress indicator.


Best of luck.

Thanks.  I used the FreeCAD procedure to produce the STEP file that the 
vendor says they cannot use. If you read what they say, it reads, in 
part, "[must be] generated directly from a native CAD format. Saving a 
part in STL format deletes some of the information that we require."

My point is that I may not be the only person who will eventually trip 
on this step.

Intrigued about the reference to not using hull(), I imported my recent 3d
print file into SW. I've found hull() to be invaluable for conversions of
shapes along a linear reference. I needed a vacuum manifold to lie flat on a
surface and the model I created fit the bill perfectly. I would not be able
to have this injection molded, as per the OP, but it looks even cooler in SW
than it did in OpenSCAD:

I had no idea that FreeCAD could import OpenSCAD.  Of course, as it 
turns out, it cannot.  You need to download some DXF libraries.  And the 
procedure to do that is ASTONISHINGLY long and complex.  I gave up.  
Maybe some other day.

Thanks for explaining that this alternative exists: I did not know about it!

Sorry, I left out something important. When you export into FreeCAD, you 
export from OpenSCAD as CSG, not STL. There is a huge difference between 
these, and using CSG will result in native CAD primitives that can be used.

Another point.

If there is an easy way to do it, then a competent tooling producer will
know how to do it and accept STL as input 8)

Yona:

You have been very helpful, but FreeCAD keeps telling me that the DXF 
libraries need to be installed (even when opening a CSG file), and that 
appears to be a Herculean task.  I do not understand why the automatic 
install fails, but it does.

The message they are really trying to express is this:
- a triangulated mesh file is not able to be used by them to machine your
part.
- they want a solid model constructed from solid primitives.
Of course you should validate with them that this is correct.

I believe Solidworks might have such a tool but AFAIK it's an open problem
to convert an arbitrary mesh to a booleaned set of solid primitives. AFAIK
this hasn't been solved yet. But I'm happy to accept solidworks has a
solution.

So what they are saying they want - is a model in STEP format comprised of
solids.
OpenSCAD has no STEP exporter.
FreeCAD - do not know but suspect you would have to remodel in this, or any
of the other suitable CAD packages.

The FreeCAD openSCAD importer does look like it does the right thing but as
other commenters have said - you can't use the more idiosyncratic prims like
hull. Must be straight solid prims and boolean ops only.

OK. just tried the procedure using FreeCAD - works remarkably well.
1. Loaded the openscad file into openscad and saved as csg.
2. Downloaded freecad 0.15 - I'm on windows - can't speak for other
platforms.
3. Followed instructions here:
http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Import_OpenSCAD_code
4. started FreeCAD 0.15
4. Edited preferences and under Openscad - told it where the openscad binary
was.
5. Changed to openscad workbench
6. Opened the csg file previously saved
7. appears as a nice set of primitives (I had a nicely behaved file made out
of cubes, using difference and mirror ops)
8. Exported as STP file

Resulting stp file is indeed made of primitives and not a polygon mesh.
High probability this would convert OK.

@jon_bondy if you can't get it to work - PM me and I'll have a go for you.

Thanks SO much!  I will get back to you once I've had time to repeat 
your steps!

Sounds like a exam question.

As OpenSCAD doesn't allow a=a+1 variable reassignment, you would need keep
track at the calling level.
That would depend in the structure of your program and how you calculate how
many times and lengths you use. A recursive technique could be used.

That's what I did:

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Design/Reload and Preview
Message-ID: <1469776090453-18006.post@n5.nabble.com>

Is F4 meant to /only/ reload if the source file has changed, as it  does now?

If there are unsaved changes in the editor, but source unchaned, should it
do like File/reload and ask if you want to reload and lose changes?

Now if the file has not changed it does not reload and does not compile;
should it compile anyway?

(I don't normally use F4, but had a new keyboard with intermittent faulty Fn
keys so wasn't sure what was happening or supposed to)

To my understanding, there's no parser capability in OpenScad. The only
thing I found close is something described in  String Theory, a string
library for OpenSCAD <http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:526023>   (also check
out the comments), which is far from a full-scale text-file parser, not to
mention that OpenSCAD cannot read a text file as a string.

This is also not possible in OpenSCAD. However,  blobule
<http://forum.openscad.org/template/NamlServlet.jtp?macro=user_nodes&user=1094>  
developed some stuff to calc the center and vol of a mass, from there it
might be possible to the the dimension (my really wild guess):
