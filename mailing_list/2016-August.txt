I'd suggest starting with something less ambitious.
Read the  manual <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual>  ,
checkout the examples, then understand the lithophane OpenSCAD code on
Thingiverse here <http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:74322>   and  here
<http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:78719>  .

Or maybe just try  this <http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1181437>  .

Should be quite straightforward.

Create a single JPG or PNG with all your images in the appropriate places
to wrap around the cylinder.

Then go to  Thingiverse and search for my item "openscad wrap image curved
surface". Sorry, I can't figure out how to get a hyperlink on my phone.
You'll also need Python. Use Python to generate a. Scad file, then openscad
to make an STL.

That tends to be the final union of all the objects, CGAL is not helpful in
knowing what it is doing under the covers.

I don't know if anyone has thought to estimate the complexity before calling
CGAL to give some warning of how long it may take.

It's going to look something like this:
(this code will not work as written)

files=["image1.png","image2.png","image3.png","image4.png"]; //all of these
files MUST be png, and MUST be in the same directory as your scad file
height=//height of lampshade
radius=//radius of lampshade
thickness=//thickness of the lampshade
inner_radius=radius-thickness;
translucency=// a range from 0-1.01 which will change the thickness of
relief of the images, depending on if you want a lithophane or a cutout

difference (){
    cylinder1();//outer cone
    cylinder2();//inner cone
    for(i=[0:len(files)-1]){
        translate()//center the image
            rotate([90+atan(height/radius),0,i*360/num_images]) //rotates
the image from facing up to facing normal to the lampshade, and rotates the
images around the z axis
                resize([,,thickness*translucency])
                    surface(file=files[i]);
    }

That should get you started. If you cant do it, I'll write it up and put it
up on thingiverse.

I'm using OpenSCAD version 2015.03-1  which seems to be the best I can 
get for Ubuntu without learning a whole lot more about git. That may be 
the problem.

I also appreciate the super fast reply when I couldn't get a subtraction 
of a little cylinder from a bigger one. That got me into a much bigger 
operation that's working well. But. . .

What is turning my screws into arrowheads? I have extracted 90 percent 
of the otherwise working file and I'm trying to show a dozen machine 
screws that will hold three rextruded together parts together. Below is 
working code extracted from a file I wouldn't dare to post here.

Please advise if you see cylinders or cones!

Wow.  I like this list and the answer quickly got me thinking right but 
something is still strange:

//works		translate([xval, yval, -screwlen/4]) cylinder(screwlen, r = 
screwrad, center = true);
//works		translate([xval, yval, -screwlen/4]) cylinder(h = screwlen, r = 
screwrad, center = true);
//fails		translate([xval, yval, -screwlen/4]) cylinder(h = screwlen, r = 
screwrad, 0);
//works		translate([xval, yval, -screwlen/4]) cylinder(screwlen, r = 
screwrad, center = true);
//cones		translate([xval, yval, -screwlen/4]) cylinder(screwlen, 
screwrad, center = true);

It looks as though the real problem is the centering but the r= seems 
necessary while the h= sometimes helps.

But it's working OK now and I can go back to harder things. Sincere thanks.

Don't use `cylinder` with positional arguments. Only use labeled arguments,
otherwise you get a surprise.

The positional parameters for cylinder are h, r1, r2 and center.
Defaults are h = r1 = r2 = 1 and center = false.

so:

cylinder(h = screwlen, r = screwrad, 0)

=> cylinder(h = screwlen, r = screwrad, h = 0)
// second h assignment is active, so no object generated


cylinder(screwlen, screwrad, center = true)

=> cylinder(h = screwlen, r1 = screwrad, center = true)
// cone as r2 = 1 as that's the default


I guess it's basically a very unexpected choice to have r1 and
r2 as positional parameter, so not using those for cylinder is
probably the best advice.
Maybe the documentation could be improved to include this
information, but it's still not going to be intuitive.

ciao,
  Torsten.

Yep, that's right.

I'm presuming due to the multi platform nature OpenSCAD does not choose a
location?

If you installed via the installer.exe edit the shortcut in the start menu,
set your default directory/folder in 'Start in'.

I generally install via the zip file and create a shortcut in the start menu
as above.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] a stupid syntax error I can't see
Message-ID: <1470515230838-18036.post@n5.nabble.com>

I obviously have some stupid syntax error that I can't figure out.  I suspect
that I need to do something for my if statement that I haven't

I've looked at the manual and my module, if, and for statements look (to me)
conformant.  But obviously I've missed something.  The line "angle = " is
flagged as being bad, but if I move it above the if statement (or remove the
if statement) it goes past that and then has an issue with inside the for
loop.

What am I doing wrong?


module rfsphere(counter,geometry,growth,xoffset,yoffset,size)
  {
  if(counter>0) 
    {
    angle = (360/geometry);
    ratio = (1 / (geometry / 2));
    newcounter = counter - 1;
    newgeometry = geometry + growth;
	  newsize = size * ratio;
    for(i=[1:1:geometry])
      {
      xoffset = xoffset + (size * sin(angle*i);
      yoffset = yoffset + (size * cos(angle*i);
      translate([x,y,0]) {
		   sphere(newsize, $fn=100);
      }
      rfsphere(newcounter, newgeometry, growth, xoffset, yoffset, newsize);
    }
}

Could it be that curly bracket after translate that is not closed?

The two lines with offset in them, xoffset and yoffset are missing trailing )
and the entire module needs a closing }

I did not test any other aspect other than to identify the syntax problems.

In addition to the other issues mentioned, are you using an old
version which does not allow assignments everywhere?

Thanks for picking up those errors. I did not see the missing closing brace
or the missing parens.  But even after those are fixed, it oddly still
complains that there is a syntax error on the first assignment.  Is
something wrong with my "if" syntax?

it still highlights the whitespace character just after "angle =" and says
there is a syntax error on that line


module rfsphere(counter,geometry,growth,xoffset,yoffset,size)
  {     
  if(counter>0) 
    {
    angle = (360/geometry);
    ratio = (1 / (geometry / 2));
    newcounter = counter - 1;
    newgeometry = geometry + growth;
    newsize = size * ratio;
    for(i=[1:1:geometry])
      {
      xoffset = xoffset + (size * sin(angle*i));
      yoffset = yoffset + (size * cos(angle*i));
      translate([x,y,0])
        {

        }
      rfsphere(newcounter, newgeometry, growth, xoffset, yoffset, newsize);
      }

The use of the variables x and y should be xoffset and yoffset I think.

I don't get a syntax error or any error message when F5 on the module alone.
Calling the module from outside results in an error, because your module
contains a call to your module. Should the code you've presented be
separated into two distinct segments?

You and Drew pointed out that I'd meant xoffset and written x.

I was just showing the recursive part of my module.

Even after correcting x by chaning it to xoffset (and the same for y) I
still get a syntax error on the first assignment (which confuses me).

I'll put all the code here (recursive and non recursive parts), it still
flags the "angle =" line as being bad.  Which makes me wonder if my if or
module syntax is wrong.

module rfsphere(counter,geometry,growth,xoffset,yoffset,size)
  {     
  if(counter>0) 
    {
    angle = (360/geometry);
    ratio = (1 / (geometry / 2));
    newcounter = counter - 1;
    newgeometry = geometry + growth;
    newsize = size * ratio;
    for(i=[1:1:geometry])
      {
      xoffset = xoffset + (size * sin(angle*i));
      yoffset = yoffset + (size * cos(angle*i));
      translate([xoffset,yoffset,0])
        {
		   sphere(newsize, $fn=100);
        }
      rfsphere(newcounter, newgeometry, growth, xoffset, yoffset, newsize);
      }
    }
  }

module fsphere(counter,geometry,growth,size){
	sphere(size, $fn=100);
	counter = counter - 1;
   newsize = (1 / (geometry/2))*size;

   angle = 360/geometry;
   ratio = 1 / (geometry / 2);
   newgeometry = geomertry + growth;
   for(i=steps(1,1,geometry)) {
	   x = size * sin(angle*i);
      y = size * cos(angle*i);
      translate([x,y,0]) {
		   sphere(size*scale, $fn=100);
      }
      rfsphere(counter, newgeometry, growth, x, y, size*scale);
    }
}

fsphere(4,3,2,100);

You can't do assignments inside a conditional in openscad. It's part of the
fact that openscad variables aren't really variables. You're also changing
the values of variables later, which isn't allowed either.

You can do conditional variable assignment using the ternary operator, but
for this purpose, it doesn't look like it's necessary, just set your
variables before going into the if statement. Getting rid of the
reassignments will be a little more complicated.

What version of OpenSCAD are you using? The following works on version 2015.03-1 on a Mac:

module rfsphere(counter,geometry,growth,xoffset,yoffset,size)
   {
   if(counter>0)
     {
     angle = (360/geometry);
     ratio = (1 / (geometry / 2));
     newcounter = counter - 1;
     newgeometry = geometry + growth;
     newsize = size * ratio;
     for(i=[1:1:geometry])
       {
       xoffset = xoffset + (size * sin(angle*i));
       yoffset = yoffset + (size * cos(angle*i));
       translate([xoffset,yoffset,0])
         {
            sphere(newsize, $fn=100);
         }
       rfsphere(newcounter, newgeometry, growth, xoffset, yoffset, newsize);
       }
     }
   }

rfsphere(5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

I should probably update
Trying to debug it as it isn't doing what I wanted (found a bunch of
mistakes so far, recursion is always messy though).

Yeah, upgrading would be a good thing. I think you could do what you're trying to do by using the
"assign" statement in the version you're using. The assign statement has been deprecated in later versions so it's probably best to not start using it.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Tips for OpenSCAD on Windows 7
Message-ID: <1470595013509-18083.post@n5.nabble.com>

I having issues running OpenSCAD on Windows 7.

The problems are OS caused and I want to get some "happy ballance".

I am doing stuff that seems to be calculation intensive but Windows goes to
sleep and nothing is done during sleep.

I know I can set the computer to "never sleep" but I'm wondering if there is
some better middle ground like "if application/process X is running let it
have what it wants"  By that I mean the OS could turn the screen off (I
don't need a display while it is calculating) and if it isn't swapping to
disk let the disk spin down to an idle.

What do other people on Windows do?  I would prefer to garner some power
savings by letting some resources go idle.

I am using 2015.03

I was having problems using the use command (source code at the bottom).

I got an error that said: "WARNING: Can't open library
'metric_fastners.scad'.

I did some digging on the wiki, and found out I could check my library
paths.

As is obvious from the screenshot, I am using windows.


?
What is messed up is that the paths have the wrong slashes. Is this what is
causing my "use" errors?

Thanks,

?

The slashes (mixed up set of / & \) in your library info are the same as
mine.

As well as the source, please show the paths to the main program and the
metric_fastners.scad files.

Probably not. Internally Windows can use either forward or back slashes.

'Control Panel/Power Options/Change Plan Settings/Change Advanced Power
Options' lets you set individual options for hard disc, display, sleep and
other things.
I don't have much power saving ATM, but I tend to do display off first, disc
off shortly thereafter, sleep a lot later (but off if I'm in a process heavy
state). ATM, I manually hibernate via the start menu when I'm not going to
use it. (tho hibernate v's sleep is due to a error waking from sleep, but
hibernate saves  more power)

I got impassioned by the huge sculpture that adorned the caldron on the 2016
Oplympic Games oppening here in Rio de Janeiro. The spiraled movements
bewitched me. The reflections on the metalic surfaces had dramatic effect. I
could not resist to model and animate it.

OlympicGame2016_Sun.scad
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n18088/OlympicGame2016_Sun.scad>  

The apparent intricacy of the movements is in fact very simple but
ingenuous. The sculpture was made by the american artist Antony Howe. There
are many videos on the  sculpture in Youtube
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyx1u_94cN0>  . Enjoy it!

Interestingly, if we connect all moving Sun disk positions at a given time,
we get two interwoven T(2,1) torus knot!

You could not do it with linear_extrude which just twists around the
extrusion axis. If I understand well your problem, you need a helical
extrusion. If I am right, you will need some sweep operator. See
https://github.com/openscad/list-comprehension-demos

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Why rotate() and $vpr use opposed rotation orders?
Message-ID: <1470690683750-18092.post@n5.nabble.com>

AFAIK, rotate([a,b,c]) is equivalent to:

rotate([0,0,c]) rotate([0,b,0]) rotate([a,0,0])

which is opposed to the usual Euler angle order. However, the angles
expected by $vpr assignments are taken in the inverse order: first Z, last
X.

I wrote a function to calculate the Euler angles of a viewport frame in
order to feed $vpr. But I cannot use it with rotate(). I would expect the
same rule in both.

$vpr use Euler angle rotation order. The issue is the rotate() order.
Another legacy?

It is easy to do your own e_rotare() module.
