That's QScintilla functionality. We can enable/disable AutoIndent. Otherwise I
don't see much options to change that behavior.

echo(substring(4, 3, [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]));
echo(substring(4, 3,"012345678910"));

You may want to modify it to [start-1:start+count-2] if you want the first
index to be 1.

Thanks for the suggestions, guys. It's almost there, but not quite.

nopheads variant takes in start and end, but I want start and length.

Bananapeels variant returns a list(?) of characters, not a string.

I tried to write my own, like this, but it fails on a syntax error, and I
don't see why:
  function substring(string, start, length) = for(i=[start:start+length-1])
str(string[i]);

That is actually the correct handling of these kind of errors.

Remember that newlines are actually ignored in the code. Here is an example
that is valid;

test
=
20
;
word
=
"test"
;

If the first ; is removed then 'word' is the first place in the code where
the syntax is wrong, and that is where the error will pop up.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Wishes for code navigation
Message-ID: <1420144690819-10865.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi, I've got some wishes for the editor and navigating in code.

When a .scad file contains several modules I find the navigation to be less
than ideal. I wish there was a way to jump to the definition of a module
(F12 in Visual Studio, F2 in QT creator). 

In both Visual Studio and QT creator there is also a dropdown at the top of
the editor that lists all the methods. Perhaps OpenSCAD could have the same
type of dropdown for navigating to modules?

I also wish the module definition navigation understood that some modules
are defined in external .scad files, and that they were opened up when
navigated to. 

This also leads me to another wish - that instead of opening several
instances of OpenSCAD, each file should live inside its own tab in the same
instance.

What do you think?

OK then let me rephrase the comment.

Given that the construction <var> = <constant> <var> is syntactically
incorrect, the scanner should position the red box /before /the second var
rather than after it since the most likely assumption is that something
should have appeared between the constant and the second var, like an
operator or a ";".  IMHO.  Not a big deal.

I've been trying to get to the equivalent point in the Linux build docs for
getting all the testing stuff working properly.

When I try to run git init


eventually I had success doing a cleanup of all my failed stuff:


the submodule loaded and the files appeared.  (In truth a bunch more
fiddling and fu went on, but I _think_ those were the relevant parts.)

So then I tried to do the equivalent of:

using qmake instead of cmake.  That didn't work

Having then done the requested installs of cmake and imagemagick described
in the tests folder WinReadMe file, I thought maybe I should follow its
instructions and run the OpenSCAD_Test_Console.py


I swapped the order of

to be before the move to tests-build that it makes.  This got me a little
farther:


I then thought that instead I should be following the Linux instructions so
I tried cmake:


It looks like this all probably relies on the scripts like
./scripts/uni-build-dependencies.sh
which I wasn't clear were ready for the MSYS2 build world.

In any event (whew) before I kludge up my install any more, is there a
best-path sequence I should be attempting?

Well everything is possible, but it costs, in development effort, code bloat,
learning curve etc.

For me, I'd like dev resources to focus on 1. bug fixes, 2. performance, 3.
modelling (for want of a better word) features/convenience (ie enhance the
language), the concept of an IDE is down the list for me, granted the
Scintilla change is very nice, but for anything big, I'll be using Notepad++
with OpenSCAD Auto-completion (so I just have to type 't' to get
'translate([').

Maybe the best you could do would be to find an open source IDE 'library'
that could be more easily incorporated and which is compatible with
Scintilla.

Don't mean to be overly critical...

Seconded Michael. I love OpenSCAD and use it as my primary modelling
software, but I've never typed a line of code into it. I use notepad++
with the syntax highlighting plugin.

There are function list plugins for notepad++ too. They might fulfill
some of your requirements.

I LOVE working with .scad in Notepad++.  It's a pleasure and tremendously
more powerful than using the built-in editor.  The only thing about
Notepad++ that's missing for me is a concept of 'project', but that's
massively outweighed by something as simple as column select (a feature I
can't live without.)   Maybe it's just because my .scad dev efforts are too
small to require a full IDE yet so Notepad++ meets my needs.  Bigger
efforts will eventually benefit from an IDE for .scad work.

But is OpenSCAD (as an app) trying (currently) to be an engine or an IDE?
It helps to have a focus.  The feature list for a good IDE is painfully
long (and causes religious wars between developers.)  Kinda sorta aiming at
becoming both concurrently is a tough way to make meaningful progress.  My
vote is for a more powerful engine first.

It does make me wonder about trying to write a NetBeans plugin for OpenSCAD
(I'd rather shoot myself than use Eclipse.)  I have no idea what's
involved, but I'll start reading.  It would be overkill for all but the
biggest efforts, but efforts appear to be getting bigger so who knows!

Well, if you had a program that was just an stl viewer, could script up vim
to compile.

Sorry, this is probably what you want:

function substring(string, start, length) = length > 0 ? str(string[start],
substring(string, start + 1, length - 1)) : "";


echo(substring("abcdef", 2,3));

ECHO: "cde"


Your version is a syntax error because you have used a for statement where
an expressions is required. Possibly confused by list comprehension syntax
that can build lists with a for statement that can then be used in an
expression where a list is needed.

Just as an FYI, NetBeans language support looks a bit tedious but basically
straightforward.

http://wiki.netbeans.org/How_to_create_support_for_a_new_language
<http://wiki.netbeans.org/How_to_create_support_for_a_new_language>  

A lot of the lexer and parser stuff may be reusable(ish) from what's in the
source .  The syntax highlighting may be at least partially reusable form
the Notepad++ implementation.

I do all of my OpenSCAD development in vim with the OpenSCAD "Automatic
Reload and Compile" option turned on. No need for any vim scripting.

I would definitely prefer the OpenSCAD engine be improved more than
updating IDE features. I see the OpenSCAD editing as a nice-to-have
feature that I will mostly ignore.

For bigger projects, I tend to use the OpenSCAD command line features
and a Makefile to build stuff (all the way through slicing to gcode).
So the OpenSCAD editing features are irrelevant to me.

Just another opinion.

warning() and error() would be better than echo() as they could use the built
in coloring.

And error() could be used somewhat like a breakpoint, so that you get the
red error-dot in the editor.

My workaround so far is this;

module warning(message) {
	echo(str("WARNING: " , message, ""));
}

Sure, I don't disagree that improving the engine is more important than the
IDE, but some minor improvements might still be worth the effort. 

Tim asked if OpenSCAD is trying to be an IDE or an engine. I'd say it's an
application with both a frontend and a backend. Both are important. Sure,
having a perfect IDE isn't worth much if the engine sucks, so I'm inclined
to agree that the backend/engine is the most important. But for attracting
and keeping new users of OpenSCAD I'm also thinking that the workaround with
using an external IDE (yes, I think that is a workaround, not a proper
longterm solution) isn't good. The built-in IDE should be good enough so
that an external editor isn't required.

It can often be difficult to achieve consensus about things like good
enough.  One tool that we use at my work a lot is benchmarking, i.e.
measuring ourselves against some other site/tool/product that has a level of
functionality that we want to reach/exceed.  Consensus on a benchmark can be
difficult as well, but generally easier than on a feature by feature basis.  

Are there any (in this case development or editor) apps that you feel have a
feature set that would meet the level of functionality that you're
visualizing?

I think a good editor should be syntax-directed and offer the following:

1. parenthesis matching
2. auto-indent, aka pretty-print
3. line numbering
4. keyword completion (type "dif<TAB>" and it prints "difference")
5. template generation (type "difference" and get "difference () { }")

I don't need every piece of text in a different color.

Personally,  l feel that it is much better to have some support your editor
of choice than to continue to tweak OpenSCAD built-in editor. I'd I wanted
that editor to do everything that vim can do, I would use vim (and I do).

I do not understand why people would want to have superficial experience
with several limited editors when they could be using one powerful editor.

A simple plug in for NetBeans or even eclipse that invokes the viewer in
the correct mode would go far with many users.

For me, 1-3 is great and I crave chromacoding (colored words.)  I'm less
fond of templating.  I don't like having to erase all the extra parens and
brackets it puts in because I didn't type things in the order it demands,
slows me down and I turn it off.  Keyword completion is okay as long as
it's TAB driven.  I hate having to fiddle with the drop down selector
between similar names.

I do like function spec tooltips describing the required fields and such.

But I'm getting all my needs met using Notepad++ along with a huge number
of other features.

I kind of imagine the editor in OpenSCAD to be like GLUT in OpenGL, just
barely enough to do something as a test, but not a tool designed to do
heavy lifting.  I'm somewhat sympathetic to the idea that new users will be
too confused to use an editor of choice, so I'll keep chewing on that
perspective.  But meeting new users (new programmers really,) needs is a
different goalset than meeting the needs of folks with bigger project
needs.  Chasing that goal means being an editor development project, which
is a shame given how many good ones are out there.

Good discussion!

Okay, here's a requirement. Whenever OpenSCAD detects an error, I would like:
(1) to see an error message with the correct file name/line number;
(2) to see the error in context, by displaying the source file, and
the line containing the error marked in red.

One of the cases where this doesn't work today is when the error is in
an included library file. In that case, requirement (2) could be
satisfied by supporting some kind of IDE integration more
sophisticated than just the "Automatic Reload and Compile" option, or
it could be satisfied by supporting tabbed editing, so that multiple
source file tabs can be grouped with a single output pane and error
message pane. In the latter case, OpenSCAD could open an included
source file that contains errors in a tab, so that it can highlight
the lines containing errors.

I'm not arguing that OpenSCAD should necessarily contain its own
sophisticated IDE (I agree engine work trumps this), but it would be
great to at least support proper workflow for reporting and fixing
errors in source code. Also, I think that a significant portion of the
work required for proper error reporting is actually in the engine (by
which I mean the compiler and the run-time, since errors are often not
detectable until runtime since OpenSCAD doesn't use (or need) static
type checking).

PS I looked at the netbeans API link provided by tdeagan, and although
it talks about syntax error highlighting, I don't think this API helps
us to get error messages out of OpenSCAD and into an IDE for the
purpose of highlighting errors in the context of a source file.

I agree, the quick version doesn't do this, but I know a lot of other
languages have some means of doing so with NetBeans so I'll investigate.

I am really interested in this set of requirements.  Constructing an
advanced editor capability as an artifact of creating a more powerful
debugging experience (rather than as YAEditor).  That bridges the engine/UI
question in a really interesting way.  I'm not sure what the command line
does at this point (I've never used it when having errors, be nice if there
was a super simple script that had a target flaw for debugging.)

interesting stuff!!

What about an ability to redirect the errors and warnings from the console
to stdout or stderr? That way you could easily have a parser in the editor
for syntax highlights in editor of choice.

What would be slick would be able to figure out on a statement by statement
basis if the volume of a construct is approximately 0.

I guess there's not a massive demand for it - I can only find one other

Thanks. Here?s a hack you can use for now. I don?t dare to include this right now as I?m not sure if it might break e.g. update behavior:

One one of your OpenSCAD.app in Finder:
o Right-click->Show Package Contents
o Open Contents->Info.plist in a text editor
o Change the bundle identifier, to something else than ?org.openscad.OpenSCAD?, e.g.:
	<key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
	<string>org.openscad.OpenSCAD-snapshot</string>

You might have to rebuild the LaunchPad database afterwards, see e.g. http://osxdaily.com/2011/08/01/refresh-launchpad-in-mac-os-x-10-7-lion/

Message-ID: <1420308426582-10895.post@n5.nabble.com>

This code:

outerD = 60 ;       // Outside diamater
wearFactor = 0.07 ; // Reduce by this much to compensate for stretch
outerD = outerD - (outerD * wearFactor) ;

generates these errors:

Compiling design (CSG Tree generation)...
WARNING: Ignoring unknown variable 'wearFactor'.
WARNING: Ignoring unknown variable 'outerD'.
WARNING: Ignoring unknown variable 'outerD'.

But for the life of me I don't see what I'm doing wrong.  Help!

(Without the second and third lines above, the object renders just fine).

You can't use the same name to represent two values in OpenScad, because
they are constants not variables.

This works and also makes sense mathematically and is easier to understand:

targetOuterD = 60 ; // Outside diamater

wearFactor = 0.07 ; // Reduce by this much to compensate for stretch

outerD = targetOuterD - (targetOuterD * wearFactor) ;

<https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/General#Variables>  


works because outerD is only defined once.  In your code the compiler is
ignoring the original declaration and only paying attention to the second
one.

That's what I _believe_ is happening.  The gurus will undoubtedly be able to
give a better understanding.

/"Variables are set at compile-time, not run-time"/

OK, well since this seems to be my day for dumb questions - how did you get
my code fragment to come out in a fixed pitch font?  I don't see any font
buttons in this editor window.

Hidden under the More button in the web page forum there is a menu item for
Raw Text.  It will put  tags around whatever you've selected.  Not sure how
to do it on the email side of things

I am using gmail so it is just the font selection drop down under
formatting options: Fixed Width.

Huh - well whadaya know about that?  So "raw text" means "fixed pitch".  I
guess you really do learn something new every day.  Or in my case  :-) 
Thanks.

Note that using raw has had the enclosed code not appear in the emails sent
to the mailing list on at least two occasions in the past. Not sure what
causes it, so I tend not to use it. YMMV

That?s correct. Such formatting does indeed not make it through to the mailing list.
I?m accepting assistance If anyone wants to help out figuring this out :)

Well Joe Lenox is kindly helping me port Openscad to Sparc Solaris (well
actually, he's doing it all himself), so I guess the least I could do is
offer to help with this - if I can.

The challenge is that somewhere between Nabble?s input form and the underlying mailman mailing list, the formatted text disappears.
This may be a problem with Nabble, a problem with mailman, or a configuration issue with either of them. Not sure where to start looking.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Antialiasing when doing image export?
Message-ID: <1420403125926-10912.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi, I'm using the commandline export to file functionality to generate some
images of my model. 

For OpenSCAD itself I've set some anti-aliasing settings in the AMD Control
Center, so that lines are smooth when I preview a model in OpenSCAD. But,
when I export to file via the commandline the antialiasing doesn't work.
I've set the AA settings for both the openscad.exe and openscad.com files,
but it's not looking pretty.

Here is a screenshot of the model in OpenSCAD next to the same model
exported to file. Notice the jagged lines.
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n10912/Antialiasing.png> 

The command I used to export the cube was:
"%PROGRAMFILES%\OpenSCAD\Openscad.com" -o images\cube.png -D $fn=100
cube.scad

Any suggestions for how I can make the exported image look better?

Using large values for --imgsize=width,height and scale down the
image should allow pretty much give same effect as the anti-aliasing
settings.

Two tips:

1) You're likely using an older version of OpenSCAD. Your designs worked for
me using the latest development snapshot.
2) The cause of the problems are likely that your cutouts are dimensioned
exactly. This may leave infinitely thin walls. It's smart to let cut-outs
slightly larger than necessary.

Just a suggestion.... here's a much more concise version of the main body...


hull(){
translate([0,0,32])cube([16,16,.01]);
translate([4,4,24])cube([8,8,8]);
}
hull(){
translate([0,0,0])cube([16,16,4]);
translate([4,4,20])cube([8,8,8]);
}
translate([0,0,22])cube([16,16,4]);

Hi, welcome to the forum.
This concept has been under discussion for some time.
I imagine it will get done eventually, but there is great debate about the
best way to do it ATM.

BTW if your next post (after a fee minutes) is still flagged as "This post
has NOT been accepted by the mailing list yet" you should check your 
subscription

This post shows an easy workaround using a simple shell-script/

Thanks, that helped. 

I can go as high as --imgsize=4096,4096. That gives a lot smoother edges.
Here is a comparison without ---imgsize, and with it set to 4096.
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n10948/CubeBetter.png> 

I started getting errors when trying --imgsize=8192,8192.

Maybe the second dot in your file name throughs OpenSCAD off.
The extension is used to decide between .stl and .dxf(?) import.

Thanks for the reply Peter. I dragged and dropped the stl file and that
worked. For some reason, typing it in does not. <shrugs>

I've reduced the crash down to something like this:

echo(search("A", ["A", "Apple"]));

A file with just this code terminates OpenSCAD on my machine [Win 7
Enterprise, 64 bit].
This seems reasonable. I'd expect to see [0] returned.  Am I missing
something?

Message-ID: <1420747650371-10957.post@n5.nabble.com>

The OpenSCAD cheat sheet is labelled "2014.03" and includes a link to the
chr() function.
I have 2014.03 installed on my machine but using the first example

echo(chr(65), chr(97));      // ECHO: "A", "a"

produces a warning that 'chr' is an unknown function and the output is
undef, undef.  
What am I missing?


Note also that the chr() help talks about requiring version *2014.QX*.  That
goes to a link in *GitHub*, which isn't very helpful.  Is 2014.QX now
2014.03?

The labeling of the cheat sheet is wrong. We should really have two cheat sheets, one for the latest release and one for the development snapshots.
Version 2014.QX is the upcoming release (X == 5 ;))

It should be:

echo(search("A", [ ["A", "Apple"] ]));

Of cause it should not crash, but report the invalid search vector.

Thanks.  I think I see why that gets around it.  It's searching the vector,
looking at each element in turn. By default it's looking at the 0th
"column" of each element (index_col_num=0), but in my case, the elements
have no columns because they're strings rather than vectors.
So

echo(search("A", [ ["A"], ["Apple"] ]));

also works.
It might be nice if search did actually handle the "degenerate" case of
column 0 and N/A columns.

Ahh, right, that's the other version that works :-). But search() does require a vector of vectors for the values to search in.

The fix will result in a warning message and an empty result as soon as it hits an entry that is not correct:

echo(search("F", [["A", "B", "C", "Y"], ["D", "E", "F"]], 1, 2));

// ECHO: [1]

echo(search("F", [["A", "B", "C", "Y"], ["D", "E", "F"]], 1, 3));

// WARNING: Invalid entry in search vector at index 1, required number of values in the entry: 4. Invalid entry: ["D", "E", "F"]
// ECHO: []

ciao,
   Torsten.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Make discovering assign() easier!
Message-ID: <1420755445902-10964.post@n5.nabble.com>

I just spend a frustrating couple of days discovering and then working around
the whole can't-reassign-variable-values thing.  I'm an experienced
programmer so when got my 3D printer a year ago I just dived into OpenSCAD
and loved it.  But recently I tried to port some code (from python) and of
course got cryptic syntax errors when trying to modify variables.  I
understand now (kind of) and I refactored my code to be recursive and use
assign() [maybe let() will make it even easier, next release?].

This clearly happens to many people (try googling!).  My question for the
forum is how to make the situation better?  I suspect a minor tweak to the
cheat sheet would help a lot, since it is the one thing newbies probably
look at.  Consider the top-left corner
  var = value;
Firstly, "var" is a little misleading; we're not dealing with variables in
the traditional programming sense.
The word "Note!" here, in red, linking to a few words about assign etc might
save an enormous amount of heartache!

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Error !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Message-ID: <1420758620535-10966.post@n5.nabble.com>

hi,

i'm running 2014.03 and learning polyhedron/face mapping, and i'm seeing

"Error !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" (five times thus far; prev execution yielded
ten times)

on the bash session from whence i have launched openscad.

i'm sure i'm doing something incredibly stupid with my polyhedron/faces, but
openscad has already unexpectedly closed once, and i'd like to get this
drawing completed.

when i got the openscad unexpected shutdown, i spied these messaegs on my
bash session:

openscad: ../openscad_deps/include/boost/smart_ptr/shared_ptr.hpp:653:
typename boost::detail::sp_member_access<T>::type
boost::shared_ptr<T>::operator->() const [with T =
CGAL::Nef_polyhedron_3<CGAL::Cartesian&lt;CGAL::Gmpq> >; typename
boost::detail::sp_member_access<T>::type =
CGAL::Nef_polyhedron_3<CGAL::Cartesian&lt;CGAL::Gmpq> >*]: Assertion `px !=
0' failed.

fwiw, the polyhedron is a pentagram with five faces.  here's my definition
(please don't laugh!):

polyhedron
    (points = [
		 [0, 10, 0],
		 [4, -7,  0],
		 [-4, -7, 0],
		 [-10, 0, 0],
		 [0, 0, 20]
		],
     faces = [
		  [0,1,5],
		  [1,2,5],
		  [2,3,5],
		  [3,4,5],
		  [4,0,5]
		]
     );

i then realized i was missing a point, so i went back and fixed that:

polyhedron
    (points = [
			[  0, 10,  0],
			[ 10,  2,  0],
			[  4, -7,  0],
			[ -4, -7,  0],
			[-10,  2,  0],
			[  0,  0, 20]
		],
     faces = [
		  [0,1,5],
		  [1,2,5],
		  [2,3,5],
		  [3,4,5],
		  [4,0,5]
		]
     );

the drawing does in fact draw correctly now (i've fixed the bugs that caused
"no generation"), and the problem seems to have gone away.

as "Error !!!" is a type of debugging message, i thought i'd report it.

thanks for such a great product!
yvette

This message comes from an external library (CGAL) which sometimes likes to spew out error message to the console.
It usually means that the data is somehow invalid. Instead of analyzing the data, we let CGAL handle it.
If you experience an actual crash, please try with the latest development snapshot.  A lot has happened since 2014.03..

So to be clear, in the next release, something like this:
sum = 0;

for (i=[1:10])

{

  sum = sum + i; // <- currently a syntax error

}

echo(sum);


will work?

Yes and no.

No: Reassignment will still behave as all the statements
are executed in parallel and one wins. OpenSCAD scripts
currently have no notion of time, so you can't really run
a sequence of statements.
(A bit similar to hardware description languages).

Yes: It's not a syntax error anymore and apart from the
reassignment it's possible to "set variables" inside the
for loop.

E.g.

a = 5;
b = 2;
for (i = [1 : 3 ]) {
     b = a + i;
     echo(a = a, b = b);
}
echo(a = a, b = b);

-----------------

ECHO: a = 5, b = 6
ECHO: a = 5, b = 7
ECHO: a = 5, b = 8
ECHO: a = 5, b = 2

Note that the statements are ordered as the evaluation is
currently still single threaded. That might change in the
future making the order dependent on the evaluation speed
in the different threads.

ciao,
   Torsten.

I'm regularly installing the Ubuntu-14.10 version on my Debian system which

Maybe the 14.04 build got confused somehow. I just tried installing on my
Ubuntu 14.04 VM and that worked.

The timestamp from your error message looks strange. It's 2015.01.08 19:34:37
but the current version is openscad-nightly_20150108T170026.git76dc380_i386.deb
That could mean some strange timezone problems going on...

I'm not sure how to convince the installer to reconsider, maybe

   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install --reinstall openscad-nightly

ciao,

I understand. The thing is, for many people that is a very unusual paradigm.
One they are not expecting and one that the compiler doesn't warn them about
(I'm assuming the next version is not going to say /"Warning: you know that
second 'b' is not the same as the first one, right?"/).

It's also something that is not very prominent in the documentation, and I'm
suggesting it would help if it was.

Perhaps it is time to bite the bullet and refer to them as re-definable
constants? They are not variables.

The problem is that Openscad looks so much like a programming language that
people (myself included) expect it to behave like a programming language. 
Just like C, Basic, Lisp, Fortran, C++, Cobol, PL/I, Algol, etc., etc.
support variable reassignment it's not unreasonable to assume that when you
say "x = 5" that you now have a variable called x, not a constant.

If you're going to have an untyped language then there should be no
difference between variables
and constants, and it seems like the assumption that 99.9 people out of 100
would make is that everything is a variable, not everything is a constant. 
IMAO :-)

Think of it as a description of geometry, not a program. Nothing changes
value while you are describing something.

Message-ID: <54AF2B71.90805@gmail.com>

To jump in on this discussion, I think the new functionality is pretty 
good and generally in-line with the functional nature of the OpenSCAD 
language.

I generally agree with it being slightly hard to understand, though I 
think the one barrier is the lack of an assignment keyword in OpenSCAD. 
Most folks would probably understand something like the following:

var a = 5;
var b = 2;
for (i = [1 : 3 ]) {
     var b = a + i;
     echo(a = a, b = b);
}
echo(a = a, b = b);

But in OpenSCAD, the "var" is implicit, which can be a little confusing. 
Something to learn about the language.

There is, however, a more confusing variant that wouldn't be solved with 
a `var`-like keyword:

a = 10;
for (i = [1 : 3 ]) {
     a = a + i;
     echo(loop = 1, a = a);
}
echo(outer = 1, a = a);

outputs

ECHO: loop = 1, a = 11

ECHO: loop = 1, a = 12

ECHO: loop = 1, a = 13

ECHO: outer = 1, a = 10



This is perfectly fine. The evaluation of the expression being assigned 
to the inner a happens before the redefinition of a. Some languages 
would reject referring a variable from itself during initialization.

In any case, imho, anyone familiar with learning new languages will 
simply get used to the idiosyncrasies of OpenSCAD.

Coming from a functional-programming appreciator like myself, I think 
the behavior is great because it allows easy parallelization of the tree 
evaluation, while still keeping a fairly simple syntax.

it is not done just to confuse people and be mean, it is integral to how the
language works.

Traditional programming languages have a concept of time, loops are
consecutive iteration, these terms are not in the OpenSCAD world. 

Instead of iteration (say a for() loop), the individual instantiation is a
tree structure, where each value of the for() 'variable' is in fact a
constant for that branch of the tree.

Basically each instantiation of an object has its own scope (inherited from
above in the tree) you can't pass changes up the tree to go to other
branches. All the branches are evaluated ('variables' set to the last
'constant'), then the geometry for the branches are evaluated. Currently
they are evaluated in order, but in the future they may be evaluated in
parallel.

Basically there is no time, no now and then, there is just Is. Actually how
the universe works, according to Einstein, time is an illusion.

I'm not even suggesting the language (or the Universe) change, just that the
documentation change.  A single "overview" paragraph at the start of the
documentation which contained some of these concepts would Just Make Sense.

We did make some fixes to that lately. 2014.10.2 is a development snapshot so
it may contain bugs and work in progress. When using such development
snapshots, I recommend always using the latest one.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] using openscad as a slicer to export dxf files
Message-ID: <1420820125308-10984.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hello world

I'm trying to use Matthew Venn's scad script to create a slicer that will
import stl files and then export each slicel as a dxf file. See his original
code at the bottom. 
https://github.com/mattvenn/cad/blob/master/openscad/layer_demo/layer_demo.scad

Is there a way I can write an "export dxf" module so each slice will get
exported as a dxf? (layer1.dxf, layer2.dxf, etc.)

Right now it simply prints to the console.

//define some variables
//can vars
can_radius = 6;
can_wall_thickness=1;
can_height = 30;
top_cone_h = 2;
//nozzle vars
nozzle_h=3;
nozzle_r = 2;
//calculated variable
total_can_height=can_height+top_cone_h+nozzle_h;
echo(str("can height:", total_can_height));
//global vars
smooth=20; //circular shapes are drawn with this number of edges

This is not possible today, but similar functionality is discussed in these two issues:

That could be done using a simple shell-script/batch-file that
calls OpenSCAD multiple times passing a parameter to select what
to generate/write.

I'm wondering if this has something to do with updating from an Ubuntu 
repo, when the Linux version is "Mint"?
Looks as if it did update doing it this way, here is "about" text:

OpenSCAD <http://www.openscad.org>version 2015.01.08.nightly (git 76dc380)


thanks,

Hi Marius,

Thanks for the reply. Coincidentally, I was going to email you about the
google summer of code projects. It sounds like there is some overlap.

Torsten,

Thanks for reply. I will try that out with dxf files.

Have you tried the nightly packages at http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html
?
Linux Mint is just Ubuntu, right, so those packages should work.

What about evolving the animation with an export option? Use $t to define the
slices and a box to allow export (export type by use of extension).

It's not a link - it's instructions on how to install the package.

Hmm, why not, that would just require an option to actually
render the model instead of just using the preview.

That could fit into https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/891

I think the declarative way to give meta data for export would
still be useful and cover other use-cases.

ciao,

Actually it is quite easy to implement functions with OpenSCAD in the desired
way. The trick is to recall what an integral is in the mathematical sense.
This solution works for most functions a designer would need and may easily
be adopted to create 3D surfaces with functions z = f(x,y). Just nest a
second loop and create polyhedrons. 

Here is your UFO ... 

rotate_extrude($fn = 100)
sine_fct(); 

module sine_fct(start=0, stop=360, steps=50)
{
	dx = (stop-start)/steps; 
	for(x = [start:dx:stop-dx])
	{
		polygon(points = [
		[ToRad(x), 0],	[ToRad(x), sin(x)],
		[ToRad(x+dx), sin(x+dx)],	[ToRad(x+dx), 0],
		]); 
	}
}

function ToRad(x) = x/180*PI;

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Strange rendering issue with STL and added object
Message-ID: <1420903535796-10999.post@n5.nabble.com>

All:
   I have a very strange rendering problem where I am trying to add a
cylinder to an
STL file.  (Essentially this is to create a flat bottom for 3d printing). 
Below is my
openscad code and attached is the STL file.

The issue is when I do F5 the model looks like I want it to.
When I do an F6 the bottom ends up hollow.  It actually looks more like
a difference than a union.   See attached image.
Reversing the STL and Cylinder does not make a difference.
What am I missing?

//use <write/Write.scad>

baseSTL = "RECYCLING_BIN_ASM.stl";
//End settings


module can(){
        //move the stl to center the text at 0,0
        rotate([90,0,0] )translate([0,3,0]){
                    scale([0.05,0.05,0.05])
                import(baseSTL);
        }
}
union(){
        cylinder(r=11,h=4,$fn=120);
    can();
}

Normally those issues are caused by broken STL files. But in that
case it actually looks more like a bug.
The STL does not show any errors in blender or netfabb. And the
render using the OpenSCAD 2014.03 release version does produce
a different but also strange result.

I guess that needs some deeper investigation...

This is just a guess: remove the scale([0.05]) and increase the radius of
the cylinder by 20.
And see what happens.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Polyhedron issue.
Message-ID: <1420966273190-11003.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi all.
I had a polyhedron generation program all running natively in openscad that
I thought was fully working, but after a big investigation I've found that
my renders are faulty to the extent that not only can't I print with
Repetier Host, but if I print in MatterControl it appears to slice and print
fine but after I've used 20grams or so of filament, my RAMPS board just
extrudes but with no more effector movement. Tracing all this back, I have
duplicate facets that I've found using either netfab or meshlab. The meshes
look perfect from the outside.

I can run a delete duplicate facets command which leaves triangles of random
orientation and then manually correct them but this is very tedious, my
latest model has about 2500 triangles. I'd like to avoid generating the
coordinate list externally to Openscad but it's quite a mission already.
Currently, if you imagine a flat underside and top side, with a math
generated mesh stretching between, then I'm calling polyhedron once for each
top/bottom segment pair and once for each level's triangle pair per side per
level. I've seen  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8742/#files
<http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8742/#files>   which seems to call
polyhedron for each independent facet, but I'm concerned that my render is
possibly confusing vertices between triangles of different polyhedron calls
as being part of new co-incident triangles that I don't actually want.

rawradius=7.5;
levs=3 ;                //min for test
levstep=12;
sides=4;        //min for test
x_tra=16;
step=360/sides;
//translate([0,0,120]){%cube ([120,10,240],center=true);} //profile test

function completed(k)=(((k+1)/(levs+1))); //levels completed fraction of 1
function scle(l) = (sin(completed(l)*65+90)); //height scale, terminate
before 90 deg
function offset(a,d)=(((rawradius*x_tra/2)-d*5) -scle(d)* rawradius*x_tra );
function x(a,d) =( scle(d)* rawradius*x_tra * abs(sin(a/2))+offset(a,d) );
function y(a,d) =(scle(d)*rawradius*0.6 * sin(a));  //*(sin(a))*1.4

pa=[for(lev=[0:levs+1]) for (a = [0:step:360+step])
	[
		a == (360+step) ? 0+offset(a,lev) +10: x(a,lev), //x
 	        a == (360+step) ? 0 : y(a,lev), //y
		lev*levstep	//-cos(lev*9)*levstep*14	//
	] 
   ];

nxtl=sides+2;

for (level = [0:levs] , a = [0 : 1 : ((360/step)-1)]){side(a,level);}
for (a = [0 : 1 : ((360/step))]){bottom_top(a);}

module bottom_top(a){
 polyhedron(points=pa,faces=
[[sides+1,a+1,a], //base triangles
  [(levs+1)*nxtl+sides+1,a+(levs+1)*nxtl,a+(levs+1)*nxtl+1] //top triangles
]);
}
module side(a,level){
polyhedron(points=pa,faces=
[[a+level*nxtl,a+(level+1)*nxtl+1,a+(level+1)*nxtl], //side segment
triangles
[a+level*nxtl,a+level*nxtl+1,a+(level+1)*nxtl+1]//side segment triangles
]);
}

I've since found that I can run the "invert negative shells" script on
netfab, apply and then select all, flip triangles and then apply. This gives
me a valid model. However, on a fine mesh, I suspect that the duplicate
triangles are wasting render time and I suspect my implementation is rather
cumbersome with the complete points list defined at each polyhedron call but
only a partial point order definition at each call.

Is polyhedron usage documented more fully anywhere other than on the normal
openscad wiki?
Do I have to define ALL points and point orders for a single completed
polyhedron with one polyhedron command?
At the moment, I'm trying to wrap my head around reformatting the point
order lists as multiple list comprehensions encapsulated in the point order
part of the polyhedron statement but the syntax is messing with my head.

Yes you need to define a complete solid, closed polyhedron, i.e. 2
manifold, in each call of polyhedron.

I think the only case where you can get away with parts of polygons is if
you pass them to hull, but the shape has to be convex.

Solved.

One polyhedron call with flattened concatenated point order lists for end
facets and side facets.
Now renders super fast with no need to switch to wire frame mode first.

Solution:
rawradius=7.5;
levs=19 ;                //test
levstep=12;
sides=120;        //test
x_tra=16;
step=360/sides;
//translate([0,0,120]){%cube ([120,10,240],center=true);} //profile test

function completed(k)=(((k+1)/(levs+1))); //levels completed fraction of 1
function scle(l) = (sin(completed(l)*65+90)); //height scale, terminate
before 90 deg
function offset(a,d)=(((rawradius*x_tra/2)-d*5) -scle(d)* rawradius*x_tra );
function x(a,d) =( scle(d)* rawradius*x_tra * abs(sin(a/2))+offset(a,d) );
function y(a,d) =(scle(d)*rawradius*0.6 * sin(a));  //*(sin(a))*1.4

pa=[for(lev=[0:levs+1]) for (a = [0:step:360+step])
	[
		a == (360+step) ? 0+offset(a,lev) +10: x(a,lev), //x
 	        a == (360+step) ? 0 : y(a,lev), //y
		lev*levstep	//-cos(lev*9)*levstep*14	//
	] 
   ];

nxtl=sides+2;

side_orders=[for(level=[0:levs]) for (a = [0:1:360/step-1])
[ [a+level*nxtl,a+(level+1)*nxtl+1,a+(level+1)*nxtl],           //side
segment triangles
        [a+level*nxtl,a+level*nxtl+1,a+(level+1)*nxtl+1]]
];
end_orders=[for (a = [0:1:360/step])
 [[sides+1,a+1,a],    //    base triangles
    [(levs+1)*nxtl+sides+1,a+(levs+1)*nxtl,a+(levs+1)*nxtl+1]]   //top
triangles
];
function flatten(l) = [ for (a = l) for (b = a) b ] ;
eo=flatten(end_orders);
so=flatten(side_orders);
all_orders=flatten([eo,so]);
polyhedron(points=pa,faces=all_orders);

Hi Graham,

Just a few comments to clear things up:

First, there?s a small bug in your last code; you forgot the -1 on line 29:
end_orders=[for (a = [0:1:360/step-1])

It looks like this just creates some degenerate (2-vertex) triangles, but it?s probably good to clean it up.

The reason why your first version failed is that, when creating a union of separate polyhedrons, it?s crucial that the vertices where they join are _exactly_ the same. If not, small floating point differences will be preserved and cause microscopic caps which again confuses the underlying geometry engine as the geometry isn?t manifold.
You?re using the development snapshot and this is one of the remaining issues to be resolved before release. I?m not sure which version you use, but the current master should behave better than what you describe. It works perfectly for me. This behavior was updated very late december I think.

I?ll look more closely at your design later as this would be good to add to our test framework.

 -Marius

When you import an stl file, where exactly is it positioned?

I tried adjusting the values for center=true/false but that did not seem to
do anything

import("Your stl", center=true/false)

It uses the coordinates specified in the STL.

is there a module or library that can determine where the stl's origin is

i.e. getorigin();

Just curious.. did you have a look at Slic3r? I don't know if DXF is supported,
but Slic3r can export slices as multi-layer SVG file.

ciao,

thanks for the tip. that would make life easier. 

Tried it out right now. How could I split each layer in the svg into
separate svg files?

still, i've spent so much time on this issue that i am now resolved to come
up with a solution.

Unfortunately no, ATM, there has been discussion about such but no resolution
to date.

BTW, there is no center= parameter to import()

I don't know if there's existing tools, but the generated SVG looks
very regular, so it's probably easily extracted using basic XML tools
or some scripting.

Essentially it seems to be just a list of layers like:

<g id="layer1" slic3r:z="3.75e-07">
   <polygon slic3r:type="contour" points="57.85,3.44 ..." style="fill: white" />
   <polygon slic3r:type="hole" points="16.425,4.15 ..." style="fill: black" />
</g>

Another option is of cause to ask if it's possible to add an option
to Slic3r to separate the files (or maybe even export DXF too).

The focus of that project is more using a library to be able to read
more files saved by various programs. Right now the import is very
restrictive so special care has to be taken to get DXF files imported
correctly.
The project was up for GSoC and is now for "Semester of Code", but so
far there's (to my knowledge) nobody actively working on that. It would
be very nice to get that implemented, but I think it's not strictly
needed for multi-file export.

a. Your two posts are still flagged "This post has NOT been accepted by the
mailing list yet" check your  subscription
<http://forum.openscad.org/mailing_list/MailingListOptions.jtp?forum=1>  

b. As your edit implies, such errors usually mean a bad STL, posting it here
can let those of us who know the good tools can have a look at it.

c. It helps if you post your OpenSCAD version and Operating system info.

d. You may want to try the latest Development  snapshot
<http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html#snapshots>  . It has lots of
improvements, it is almost ready for release.

Oops, yep same icon and description is not good.

Building new version right now, that will have different icons and say
"Increase/Decrease Font Size".

Other changes:
- new STL export icon from Tim
- hopefully fixed Zoom (I can't reproduce the issue anymore)

I can make you one:

function getorigin () = [0, 0, 0];

Really, when you import an STL, you're using the same coordinate system within
your SCAD model as well as the STL, so the origin definitely coincides with
OpenSCAD's origin. :)

I agree!  It's very frustrating when you miss settings because they are below
the fold.  I missed a bunch of Slic3r settings for a long time because of
that.  

The challenge is the crappy height on things like the 1366 x 768 laptop I
use a lot of the time.  It _seems_ big, but a lot of app's modals can't seem
to fit in the constrained height (and a strange number of apps don't allow
resize on pref modals.)

If the preference set is too big to fit on a page, then expand/collapse
boxes for preference box sets might be an option.  

It also seems to be a common pattern now for large preference sets to have a
treeview on one side and small sets on the other.  I don't know if this is
an easy Qt paradigm or how much work it would be to refactor for that.  But
it does make the layout overall easier since any given page has just a
couple prefs.

The height could be cut somewhat by placing some of the fields next to each
other. But making it a bit bigger is simpler.

Thanks Michael

My error has gone now that I'm using a better-quality STL file as input. 
Interesting - as the problematic STL file was generated in openscad.  I
shall post my code snippet in case I've missed something fundamental in the
body generation...

Perhaps a 'bad STL' error could be produced...?  This must be a common
problem.

I'm using 2014.03 on Windoze7 & Ubuntu - comparing the two...

Cheers

Is it intentional that "Export to image" now only works after a render (F6)
and not a preview (F5)?

There was weird behaviour in previous versions where I sometimes had to hit
F5 several times before the correct image would get exported, but it appears
that now (since 2014.11.05 at least) attempting to export an image without
rendering with F6 results in an empty scene.

Sorry I should have been clearer. I tested with the latest OSX snapshot just
before posting - it is doing it with 2015.01.05

Could this be related to an issue I've had with previous versions where if I
wanted to export a number of renders using different colours, then OpenSCAD
would appear to export the render from the *previous* press of F5? 

E.g. my workflow would be:
- set colour("red"), F5, Export to image, call it RedRender.png
- set colour("green"), F5, Export to image, call it GreenRender.png
- set colour("blue"), F5, Export to image, call it BlueRender.png

but when I open up my files I find that RedRender.png would be blank,
GreenRender.png would be red, and BlueRender.png would be green, etc. I've
learned to get around this by simply saving RedRender.png twice before
moving on to the other colours.

Saving twice in this instance doesn't appear to make the render output
anything other than a blank PNG.

E.

Actually, ignore my last sentence. I just tried again with a canonical test
(50x30 cylinder) and though the first "Export to image" results in a blank
PNG, the second attempt (no re-render in-between) results in a correct PNG
output.

There must be something in my more complex file that is compounding the
issue.

Export Image is basically a screenshot of the current view port. So if
the view port is empty, the PNG will be too.

I can confirm that the font size options, both via the preferences or mouse
wheel, appear broken for me too in the simple editor.  The QS editor does
work.

Also, shouldn't the Scintilla based options be greyed-out if simple editor is

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Debugging optimized out vars on Windows
Message-ID: <1421271412485-11040.post@n5.nabble.com>

The optimizer is optimizing out some of the key variables I want to watch.  I
found this section in openscad.pro:



and changed it to -O0, which I fantasized would turn off optimization (at
the risk of the error above.  

Some of the vars I was interested in appeared, so I must have changed
something, but others, e.g. the length of the axes, l, were optimized out. 
I had imagined that nothing should be optimized out with -O0, but nope.

Any idea of a simple (or preferred) way to turn optimization off?  I'd
prefer something system rather than a function pragma or volatile for a var,
but I"ll take anything that works.

I should apologize to those reading via the mail list.  I used raw tags to
format my code segment.  The section that disappeared in the mail was:

mingw* {
  # needed to prevent compilation error on MSYS2:
  # as.exe: objects/cgalutils.o: too many sections (76541)
  # using -Wa,-mbig-obj did not help
  debug: QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -O1
}

I replaced the -O1 with -O0.

I'm getting a successful build with both -O options.  I haven't run the
entire test suite, but the app is running fine and working with the Qt
debugger.  I just can't see the values for significant variables.

I was referring to the actual debug build. On Unix systems, we build debug version using "qmake CONFIG+=debug?.
I know that was not working properly on Windows, but not sure about the state of that.

As per Subject - I get an almost-instantaneous crash exporting an STL file in
2015.01.13 (Windows7).  Model is only 8 elements.
In additon - something that would make sense is to grey out the 'STL' icon
until an F6 has been performed...

Cheers

Sorry, yes, this is the debug build.  I set up a new build kit in Qt using:
qmake.exe C:\msys64\home\tdeagan\openscad\openscad.pro -r -spec win32-g++
"CONFIG+=debug"

Worked like a champ (I did follow the instructions for the QScintilla debug
libs.)

I did have to do a rebuild all to get past some initial linking issues.  But
it worked great after that.

Wouldn't it be more useful for the non valid 2-manifold warning to be output
right after the rendering (F6) is finished instead just after selecting
"Export as STL..." from the menu?

Now that is a brilliant idea.  And how about highlighting the offending
code?

One more note on that issue.
Right now I am using version 2015.01.08 (Win7 x64) and after clicking
"Export STL..." 5 times the warning gets reported. On the 6th and forward no
warning appears as if all of a sudden the object got valid.

quoting output from console window:
"WARNING: Object may not be a valid 2-manifold and may need repair! See

We suppress warnings and errors after 5 consecutive equal messages to avoid flooding the output.
Perhaps we should reset the counter for each compile..

I used Autodesk meshmixer to slice an stl file into 2mm slices. Then I
exported the slice as an ascii stl file.

When I import into openscad, running F6 says there is "no top level geometry
to render"
F5 will show the geometry. I have also tried exporting from meshmixer as a
binary stl file but that doesn't work either.


layer2exp.stl <http://forum.openscad.org/file/n11055/layer2exp.stl>  

Attached is the stl file.

Checking the STL with Blender shows a number of different issues.
I guess the biggest problem would be: 4 non-manifold edges.

F5 can handle pretty much anything as it just displays the triangles,
but doing any CSG operation requires a solid model.

Hi Torsten,

Thank you for being a great supporter on this community

So, if I understand correctly, what you suggest is I need to get the
original 3d model file and use that instead of the stl?

Maybe that helps, I don't know. That meshmixer export is certainly
very much broken. It also has a hidden cylinder inside the visible
model, not sure how that should look like in the original model.

If you describe the whole workflow of what you are trying to do
(generating layers for laser cutting?), someone might have an idea
how to go a different route.

Marius found some even worse problems with the STL. Looks like
meshmixer really had a bad day with that model. See the highlighted
edges from the screenshot: http://imgur.com/Pd9D1Z4
Those were not even flagged by blender, probably because it was too
confusing ;-).

Hi Torsten,

Generating layers for laser cutting is exactly what I'm trying to do.

Originally I was trying to use openscad as a slicer to export to dxf but, to
the best of my knowledge, openscad does not have an export dxf module nor
does it have the ability to determine the origin of an imported stl file.
Attached is the openscad slicer I was working on. I based it on the work of
Matthew Venn and clothbot.

This is what I tried openscad_slicer.scad
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n11060/openscad_slicer.scad>  
import stl -> slice in openscad -> export to dxf

so I'm trying an alternative work flow

import stl in autodesk meshmixer --> slice in meshmixer --> export each
sliced layer as an stl->

import sliced stl layer into openscad-> export as dxf

There is probably a better way to do this.

If you?re already using Autodesk tools, why not try 123D Make?
That is the sole purpose of that program; convert from 3D to lasercut slices.

If you want to do it in OpenSCAD, that shouldn?t be too hard, but as you cannot read the dimensions of an imported file, you?d have to input those dimensions somewhere. We do support saving to DXF though.

There's not much need as OpenSCAD scripting to do slicing, pretty much
only 'file=""; projection(cut = true) translate([X, Y, -Z]) import(file);'
is needed to allow passing parameters from the command line.

See below for a simple STL to DXF converter using bash + admesh and a
couple of standard command line tools...

As there is currently no persistent cache, that's likely the slowest
slicer around :-).

ciao,

Hi Kintel,

Thanks for the tip. I'll look into it.

I am having fun with openscad and I'd like to keep exploring it. 

I take it openscad does not have an export dxf module and/or library?

Hi Torsten,

Thanks for writing up that script. It may be slow but this is a good
learning experience for me.

I'm not an expert with the command line and I am using windows not linux.
How do I run that in windows cmd?

On Windows that might be possible using MSYS2, but I guess it's easier
to just do the math manually.

* Get the bounding box of the STL via some editor and calculate the
   center of the STL in X and Y direction (for the example let's use
   center X = 10 and center Y = 5)

* Create a simple scad file with just 1 line using the center values:

projection(cut = true) translate([-10, -5, -Z]) import("your_file.stl");

* Create a batch file to call OpenSCAD multiple times, once for each
   layer, Z just changes for where you want the cuts to happen:

openscad.com -o layer1.dxf -DZ=0 slice.scad
openscad.com -o layer2.dxf -DZ=2 slice.scad
openscad.com -o layer3.dxf -DZ=4 slice.scad
openscad.com -o layer4.dxf -DZ=6 slice.scad
...

ciao,
   Torsten.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] How to prevent difference from breaking preview?
Message-ID: <1421516724889-11067.post@n5.nabble.com>

I've found if I use a difference() anywhere, the preview pane becomes
unusable. It usually displays nothing, or just a small segment of the first
difference() operation and hides all other shapes, even if they're outside
the difference.

My hackish workaround right now is to comment out the call to difference(),
and then uncomment when I do my final rendering, but obviously this is a
huge hassle.

Is this a known bug/limitation with the preview pane, or am I doing
something wrong?

I'm using version 2014.03 on Ubuntu.

No known issue which would cause such drastic problem.

There are some subtleties with difference(), perhaps you can share your
code?

Sounds a bit like broken OpenGL drivers. Could you double check that you?re using stable recent drivers for your GPU?
If that doesn?t help, could you share the content of Help->Library Info ?

translate([11,0,0]){

cube([10,10,10],center=true);

}


//difference(){

cube([10,10,10],center=true);

The preview displays that as http://i.imgur.com/NCoss8p.png

If you uncomment the difference(), the preview displays it as

I'm assuming that's Ubuntu 14.04 LTS?

Can you try the PPA which has a binary specifically build
for this Ubuntu version:

https://launchpad.net/~openscad/+archive/ubuntu/releases

ciao,

Also, that?s a really old driver. OpenSCAD generally requires OpenGL >= 2.0.
AFAIK, The 9400 M GPU is more than capable of OpenGL 2.

No, I'm using the binary
http://files.openscad.org/openscad-2014.03.x86-64.tar.gz that I downloaded
from the site's downloads page.

I'm actually still on Ubuntu 12.04. I use this machine for work, so it's
not convenient yet for me to upgrade.

That's likely a collision of the shipped driver libraries with the
NVIDIA stuff from the system (hence the OpenGL 1.4).

It might work if you rename the libGL.so.1 in /usr/local/lib/openscad/
to something like libGL.so.1.old. That should pick up the NVIDIA lib
then (which is hopefully compatible).

ciao,
   Torsten.

We're very picky about STL input. We have some ideas and wishes for
automatically repairing STL's on import (see e.g.
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/1042).
If you share your STL files, we might be able to tell you what's wrong with
it and how to fix it.

It works fine here with the latest version.

Hello OpenSCAD Community,




I want to share a short 30 minute OpenSCAD tutorial that my wife and I created. We love using OpenSCAD and created this course for new users and to introduce the software to 3D modeling enthusiasts.

It is up on Udemy and available free of cost at the following link.


https://www.udemy.com/introduction-to-openscad/#/



Please take a look and leave us a review if you have any feedback.


Thanks,

Arunanshu

I'm trying to render the following 3D model. It takes too long and crashes often.

Is this a known issue? Are there any known workarounds? I'?m using OpenSCAD 2014.03 on a 64 bit windows machine.




Thanks,

Your $fn=100 is a bit to large.
My tip: always define fn1, fn2, at the beginning of the file and set it to
lower values.
Given your $fn values, try to estimate the number of facets your`ll
produce.

Sincerely,

Ok, great, thanks - 2015.01.16 STL output now ok for my small octahedron
using 'Make_one.stl' script above.  Will try more exports as and when I
can...

It might be useful for you to use the quicky script below to pattern
'Make_one.stl' - made using the script in my post above.  This exhibits
several quirks & errors.  With small X, Y, Z - say 5 each - F5 looks fine
but F6 fails.  With X, Y, Z at 5, 5, 2  F5 is good but F6 gives the error
message...

CGAL error in CGALUtils::applyBinaryOperator union: CGAL ERROR: assertion
violation! Expr: G.mark(v1,0)==G.mark(v2,0)&& G.mark(v1,1)==G.mark(v2,1)
File:
/data/OpenSCAD/libraries-mingw64-master/mxe-w64/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static/include/CGAL/Nef_S2/SM_overlayer.h
Line: 287

... that looks similar to the error I saw when importing & patterning
'Make_one.STL' last week.

With X, Y, Z at 2, 1, 1  F5 is good but F6 gives...

Saved backup file: '###...my backup info - ignore...###'
Compiling design (CSG Tree generation)...
Rendering Polygon Mesh using CGAL...
Geometries in cache: 36
Geometry cache size in bytes: 544608
CGAL Polyhedrons in cache: 143
CGAL cache size in bytes: 968336
Total rendering time: 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds
Rendering finished.

... but no visuals and export to STL gives 'Current top level object is
empty'.

 At X, Y, Z at 1,1,1 all is good so I think that it's the 'union ()' but
removing the 'union ()' makes no difference...

Finally I used a Solidworks-generated STL 'Make_one_SW.STL' and everything
works ok.  So it's my STL file generated in openSCAD that is failing. 
Differences in the two STLs are clear - more faces in the openSCAD version
so not unified as it should be...?

//Import & pattern 'Make_one.STL' or 'Make_one_SW.STL'
X=2;
Y=1;
Z=5;
// z-pattern
for (i = [1 : Z]) {
    translate ([0,0,i*2])
    union() {	
        // x-pattern		
        for (i = [1 : X]) {
            translate ([2*i,0,0])	
            union (){
                // y-pattern
                for (i = [1 : Y]) {
                    translate ([0,i*2,0])
                   // import ("Make_one_SW.stl", convexity=3);  //un-comment
this to use Solidworks-STL version
                    import ("Make_one.stl", convexity=3); //comment this to
use openSCAD-STL version
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
//END//

Here's the 'Make_one_SW.STL' upload:

Make_one_SW.STL <http://forum.openscad.org/file/n11083/Make_one_SW.STL>  

I'm not used to this upload method to see how that works!

Cheers

Hi,
Welcome to the forum. Next time please start a new topic instead of replying
with a new subject.

Anyway, if you mean what is the overall size of the object, you can't get
that from OpenSCAD simply ATM.

The new version, see  snapshots
<http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html#snapshots>  , has an option to have
measurements shown on the axes bars.

Otherwise you need another program to look at the exported STL file. I find 
Netfabb Studio Basic <http://www.netfabb.com/downloadcenter.php?basic=1>  
quite useful.

Microsoft forced an upgrade from Win 8 to Win 8.1 a few months ago, and 
I'm still recovering from that stab in the back.

When I run OpenSCAD now, I see a dialog saying (in part) "Missing OpenGL 
capabilities - OpenCSG has been disabled").

Now, when I perform an F5 preview, some objects that are supposed to be 
differenced out are still visible, making it impossible to see what is 
going on.  Using F6 takes forever, and I cannot use % or colors to see 
what is going on.  I am finding development to be very slow.

The hardware that I have has been abandoned by AMD, so there are no 
drivers to upgrade.

Any tips?

Thanks!

Jon

You could try the Mesa Software Renderer
(See https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Building_on_Microsoft_Windows#OpenGL)

I don't know if that works on Windows 8.1, it does work fine on my Windows 7 Test VM.

You don't need to install MSYS2 for that, just download the package from either
http://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/files/REPOS/MINGW/i686/ (32 bit) or
http://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/files/REPOS/MINGW/x86_64/ (64 bit) and
find some archive tool that can handle the XZ compression and Tar files (I think
7-zip should be able to extract those).

ciao,
   Torsten.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Examples included with OpenSCAD
Message-ID: <54BD6D70.10802@gmx.de>

There will be some changes regarding the examples shipped with OpenSCAD.

Mainly all examples will be CC0 licensed which means there's no need
to think about attribution or other things when using ideas/snippets
from the examples.
(http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)

In addition we are trying to reorganize and also extend the list
of examples.

As it's not very easy to just have a look at what changed so fare, I've
generated some HTML pages with all examples, including the new ones:

e.g.: http://files.openscad.org/examples/Basics/projection.html

Suggestions for more intuitive categories or ideas which topics to
cover or complete examples would be very welcome.

ciao,
   Torsten.



List of new examples so far:

Re your problem, how thin are the walls? 

If you share your scad code we can have a look.

Does the mini print non-openscad objects OK?

A wall that is 3D printed must be either exactly twice the filament path
width or more than three times to allow room for infill. Anything in between
usually makes two single filament width walls with a gap in between.

I've installed 2015.01.16 and can confirm that the STL export that failed
previously now renders a good STL file. Many thanks for your very rapid

Thanks, Torsten.  When I run the MSYS2 installer, I get the message 
"this app cannot run on your PC" towards the end of the process.  I get 
a series of error messages.  Seems like this is not intended to run 
under Win 8.1 (which is WAY different than Win 7).  Not sure what to do.

Have a look if it still has a Windows\System32\opengl32.dll. If yes, then
just extracting the mesa version of opengl32.dll and putting that into the
same folder as openscad.exe could work.

ciao,

I've got a happy debug and release build MSYS2 environment working on both
8.1 and 7.  If there is anything I can check in my install or help with
please let me know.

urp.  reading farther back in the thread, the problem described sounds a lot
like what I got when I had to replace my hard drive and rebuild my laptop. 
Until I got the absolutely right Intel video drivers, I could not get the
OpenGL to run.  This is where I got them, but I don't know what graphics
setup you have. 
https://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?DwnldID=20046

Gulp.  I don't have any DLLs in my 2014.03 OpenSCAD folder.  Which dll is it
again you're looking for, I can see if it's in my path.

I guess

opengl32.dll

From

https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Building_on_Microsoft_Windows#OpenGL

I read


      OpenGL

OpenSCAD needs at least OpenGL version 2.0 to be able to correctly 
render the preview using OpenCSG. It's possible to run with older 
versions (e.g. the default provided by Windows which is 1.4) but the 
display might differ from the expected output.

For systems that can't provide the needed OpenGL version (e.g. when 
running on a VM) it's still possible to get the a more recent OpenGL 
driver using the Mesa software renderer.

$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-mesa

After installing the mesa driver (default location is 
C:\msys64\mingw64\bin, the driver itself is opengl32.dll), it can be 
even activated by copying it into the same folder as the OpenSCAD.exe.

It's possible to enable it for the whole system by copying it to the 
Windows system32 folder, replacing the old system driver. (Warning: Only 
do that if you have a backup and enough knowledge how to restore files 
in a broken Windows installation!)

I appear to have four copies of opengl32.dll on my system.

1066 KB  C:\Windows\System32

760 KB    C:\Windows\SysWOW64

1066 KB 
C:\Windows\WinSxS\amd64_microsoft-windows-opengl_31bf3856ad364e35_6.3.9600.17415_none_ffcff0f95d25203d

760 KB   
C:\Windows\WinSxS\x86_microsoft-windows-opengl_31bf3856ad364e35_6.3.9600.17415_none_a3b15575a4c7af07

The two 1066 KB files have the same time stamp and the two 760 KB files have
the same.

The two time stamp sets are within a minute of each other but precede the
date that I built the new hard drive for this box.  So I'm not sure exactly
how they got here, but I suspect it was the installation of the intel video
drivers since I recall having a problem getting OpenSCAD to render until I
fixed those.

I will have to build a new computer from scratch to recover from this.

Thanks for trying

If you try anything, I?d recommend installing a version of Window for which AMD has working drivers.
..or get a new/different GPU.

Message-ID: <1421719302685-11109.post@n5.nabble.com>

Is it possible to pan the view in the preview pane? I was hoping there'd be
some obvious keyboard combination to enable this, but I can't find any
mention of "panning" in the docs. All the mouse key combinations I've tried
just rotate the view while maintaining the origin in the center of the pane.

The problem is that the AMD chip set on my motherboard is so old that 
AMD stopped developing drivers for it.  Just about ANY new motherboard 
will have reasonable drivers at least for the next year or so.

The issue for me was that there were Win 8 drivers, but not Win 8.1 drivers.

These all appear to be 32-bit files; I am running on 64 bit

I'm on a 64bit windows 8.1 system. Those are the only opengl*.dll files
that are on the box.  Slic3r has some opengl.dll files in its lib, but
that's it.

The 64bit system can handle 32bit stuff (that's what WOW64 is there for).
It's not impossible that some other file is being used in their place for
64 bit, but I'd have to have some idea what to look for.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] projection() w/ meshmixer
Message-ID: <1421723688488-11117.post@n5.nabble.com>



i used simplify 3d to repair my stl and then meshmixer to slice an stl into
2 mm slices. I then exported one slice into openscad.

F6 works fine but projection() has been problematic. If I use cut=true then
I get a no top level geometry error. If I use cut=false it just takes about
an hourto process.

Attached are a couple stl file examples layer1.stl
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n11117/layer1.stl>   layer2.stl
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n11117/layer2.stl>   layer4.stl

You should not use cut=false as that projects all geometry into the XY plane. cut=true creates a cross section.
However, since your geometry lives in positive Z, you?ll have to move it down a bit, either in meshmixer or in OpenSCAD, e.g.:
projection() translate([0,0,-1]) import("layer1.stl?);

I'm working on a similar concept. Maybe we can put our heads together to
solve this issue.

I know Matthew Venn and clothbot have also tackled this issue at one point.

That's sounds as a good explanation. 
Just to male sure. With a resolution og 0.2mm dies that equal a width of 
Exactly 0.4mm or more than 0.6mm ?

Message-ID: <1421738661791-11122.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi all,

Just getting over a cold, so a little behind schedule, but I added three
more chapters in "Designing with OpenSCAD"
https://leanpub.com/designing_with_openscad/

The new three chapters are on modules and refactoring. You can read the HTML
version here: https://leanpub.com/designing_with_openscad/read

Let me know if there are any parts that are unclear, and any feedback is
welcome. Thanks!

The images might be a bit bigger, but otherwise, this is perfect.

Yes, if by resolution you mean filament width, not the layer height. 0.2mm
width seems very small for typical machines but is typical for layer height.
If you layer height is 0.2mm the filament width will be at least 0.3mm and
typically 0.4mm or greater.

If you think there are other types of examples which would be useful, list
them and I'll have a go for those within my skill level.

Do we have a target date for release?

Right, for actually using this as online doucmentation, some more
polishing of the HTML template is certainly required (e.g. zoom / hide
of the image, maybe some additional explanation, ...). I'd put that
on hold for after the release :-).

* Open issues

The hardest part is probably finding a relatively simple example that
still shows why it's useful.

- Example using hull() - https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/355
- Example using minkowski() - https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/356
- Example using resize() - https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/357
- List comprehension example - https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/814

(someone expressed interrest in doing the last one, not sure if that
still is going to happen)

Other than that there's a number of possible examples, but I don't
have a good idea how to explain those:

* Basics / Features

- Usage of modules
- multmatrix()
- math functions / calculations
- libraries (e.g. an example using MCAD)
- $fn / $fa / $fs
- Variables? (or should we start calling those constants?) 
- ...

* Other ideas are related to specific usage patterns (probably for
  the Advanced cateogory). I guess this list could be extended by
  looking through the mailing list archive for questions.

- Chain hulls
- Recursive modules
- ...

ciao,
  Torsten.

so strangely enough, i tried the same stl file without repairing it with
simplify3D and the same code to run the projection() script and now it
doesn't work.

when I used simplify3D to repair, the projection(), translate() script
works. I think the issue is with the stl file.

Just something to ponder on.

Thank you. 

It was the help I needes. 

I am working on a makerbot mini and it was giving me trouble. 
I tried different settings and ;
1 mm walls => soft like rubberband. 
1.5 mm and up => solid. 

Shells was 2 and infil 15%

As soon as possible. I'll build a Release Candidate once all critical issues are resolved. We can work on examples and docs while the Release Candidate goes through external testing.

I was assuming a single shell. For two shells it needs to be exactly 4
filament widths or more than 5 to not leave an un-fillable gap.

I did some experiments with Cura about 6 months back to see how it 
worked infill in these situations.
In my ideal world, it would inject less plastic into a gap less than a 
nozzle width...but I don't remember if it did that. It did try quite 
well though.

It seems like a good idea but when you consider the viscosity of the
plastic it needs a lot of pressure to inject it down a slot thinner than
the nozzle and as the gap tends to zero the pressure would tend to
infinity. Also the force on the nozzle would not be inconsiderable, so you
would need a very stiff Z axis or it would lift and leave a ridge.

Hi Marius,

Thank you again for providing support on this community. Attached is the stl
file.  simplify_repaired_model.stl
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n11142/simplify_repaired_model.stl>  

I'll start from the beginning
1. Import an STL file in simplify 3d, repair it, and then export it as an
stl
2. Import into Autodesk Meshmixer
3. Edit-> make slices --> Method:stacked 3d, direction : Y, thickness:2mm, 
4. Export each sliced layer as an stl. 
5. Import each sliced layer as an stl into openscad. 
6. Run the projection(cut=true) translate([0,0, -z]) import("yourstl")
7. export to dxf

A new problem is that the sliced layers are filled where there should be an
empty space. ie. a hole becomes filled.

And sometimes I get the no top level geometry error which I was able to
resolve with translate([0,0,-z])

I did try using Autodesk123D make. It can export to dxf but in some layers
it will cut the stl into separate parts and it will not allow me to control
the slice layer thickness.

Next, I may try to use Blender to export to dxf. I'm not too familiar with
blender so that's a challenge for another day.

I'll keep digging at this problem. Hopefully, this will benefit others.

Hmm, yes the pressure to fully fill the gap could spoil that 
plan...however I have printed things that end up with two thin walls and 
air in between...

Even a small round bridging bead at the top of each layer would prevent 
that. After all, the rest of the infill is usually not solid.

Anyway, ... a bit off topic.

How do you simulate right mouse button in Gnome?
e.g. how to you access context menus in other apps?

FreeCAD gets around this by having a "touchpad mouse" interface you can
select. With that, you pan with a click and drag while holding shift.

Hold Control down while using the track pad and it should act like a
right mouse button. There may be control panel settings that affect this
behavior, however. Dave

Hi,

Thanks for the STL file. I think you?re hitting the same projection bug as this: https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/1130
It looks like a bug in an underlying library - I?ve sent a bug report, so let?s see if I get any feedback.

Well continuing my perhaps quixotic quest to get Openscad on Sparc Solaris
10, I have managed to make some progress.  I now have gcc running and
installed Solaris Studio 12.4 so I also have the Sun C compiler.  I got git
and a collection of OpenCSW tools including gmake.

Then I was able to download all the needed files using git.  I also got
scripts/check-dependencies to work (although it kept spitting out "grep:
illegal option -- q" - what's that all about?),

So now I'm going down the list of dependencies.  The first one is Qt.  The
"Building Openscad yourslef" page says you need Qt4.  The script just says
Qt.  Qt is now apparently up to 5.2.

So, can I just install 5.2 or do I really have to find version 4 somewhere?

And FWIW, scripts/uni-get-dependencies.sh simply said "Unknown system type". 
Perhaps an entry for 64 bit Sparc could be added there?

I guess Solaris? grep doesn?t have the -q option. We tend to require GNU grep or a recent BSD grep.
You can edit the script and remove the -q, or install GNU grep.

This is a more updated list of dependencies. Qt 5 is recommended if it?s supported on your platform. I build binaries using Qt-5.4.

Adding such support might be an outcome of what you?re doing. It?s a bit hard to maintain though, as we?d need access to a Solaris box to test.

Sun's version of grep isn't the same as gnu grep, so there are different
switches.
For GNU Grep, -q means "quiet".

You can install GNU grep if you want, just need to edit the script so that
it uses it (as I don't think there's an env variable that it respects)

Recent versions of Simplify3D have included a fix to avoid gaps in thin
walls.
http://www.simplify3d.com/software/changelog/

Haven't tried the thin wall thing myself.

I'm not qualified to say whether it's supposed to be this way or not, but if
it's supposed to be this way I think I found the reason why. See the
attached image after one 45 degree rotation:

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n11156/cube_diagonal.png> 

So for subsequent rotation, when rotating the corner 45 (where the red and
blue meet), it won't line up.

My guess would be that it adapts the filament width to match half the wall.

This doesn't work for me. The view still rotates around the origin
regardless of how the Control key is pressed.

It looks ok to me.
FYI: rotate([45,45,45]) is equivalent to rotate([45,0,0]) rotate([0,45,0])
rotate([0,0,45]), so you can play with each component to discover why it
works as it does.
This type of rotation can be a bit counter intuitive if you're not used to
rotating stuff in 3D ;)

Isn't it the other way round ?, i.e. X first Z last so

rotate([0,0,45]) rotate([0,45,0]) rotate([45,0,0])

"Sun's version of grep isn't the same as gnu grep, so there are different
switches."

That was it.  Gnu grep was one of the utilities in my OpenCSW download so I
just added /opt/csw/gnu to the front of my PATH, ran it again and got this:

-bash-3.2$ ./scripts/check-dependencies.sh

I guess it's progress that I actually have two OK's.  OTOH, sometimes I feel
like the guy who's trying to get to the moon by climbing a tree and reports
some progress because he's reached the second branch.

"This is a more updated list of dependencies. Qt 5 is recommended if it?s
supported on your platform. I build binaries using Qt-5.4.
https://github.com/openscad/openscad#prerequisites"

18 dependencies!  That's quite a list.  And I've got two of them.  Well,
I've got Qt5 downloading right now (from here:

This thing (whatever it is) is huge.  We'll see what happens.  Thanks.

OK, so I downloaded Qt5.  But when I ran make I got "make: Warning: Can't
find 'gar/category.mk': no such file or directory"  So what the heck is
*that*?  When I search for "gar download" I get results like the UN Global
Assessment Report" on something or another, a band called Gar, and the
General Aviation Report.  Somehow, I don't think any of these are what I
need.  And no doubt gar, if I ever find it has its own list of dependencies,
none of which I will have.  Does anyone know what "gar" is and where I can
find it?

I've used let|() in list comprehensions, but it was only when I was creating
test code to complain about the lack of local variables in functions that I
discovered that  e.g.

function f5(a) = let(b=sqrt(a)) a*b;

actually works (in 2014.11.09).  Wonderful and very useful for optimisation
in my Conway operator code.

There is no mention of this in the wikibook yet.

I have been lurking for the last 9 months or so, using release 
2014.03.04.  I try to follow the examples as they fly by.

I have to say that the list comprehensions are the things that are the 
most difficult for me to grasp.  I hope that examples will be available 
for that feature.  It seems powerful.

Why is this any better than

function f5(a) = a*sqrt(a);

That's only test code and a bad example of use - in my code, the local
variable is heavy to compute and used repeatedly in the function.

returns [0,1]

I would like it to return [0] i.e. to match the vector as a unit .

any ideas?  I can use a recursive function or even a list comprehension but
they must be quite slow.

Try making it a list of vectors instead of a list of numbers:

echo(search([[2,3]],v));
echo(search([[2,3],[3,4],[1,2]],v));

Oh so it is - my bad - but "Mathematical function"?  Perhaps something under
user-defined functions since  the only other mention is in list
comprehension.

Well, the mathematical is not really fitting more of the functions listed
in that page (e.g. lookup and concat are not really math). It's also grouped
unter math in the cheat sheet.

It is mentioned in list comprehensions too, actually even has a separate
section, as that is a special use case combined with the full list
comprehension syntax.

Why user-defined, it's a built-in function?

I guess there should be some other category for things like lookup / concat /
let that do not fit into the current categories. But having "Math / other" and
and addition "other" would not help either I think.

So if someone has a good idea how to group the built-in functions, it's easy
to change in the Wiki :-)

ciao,
  Torsten.

I don't think let is a function at all. I don't know what you would call it
as it is a syntax element that groups a list of assignment statements.

I meant that let() could be mentioned in

but of course you're right - I should help rather than just question!

Hmm, nophead is right of cause, it's actually not a function at all, it's more
some syntactic means to insert assignments into expressions.

So it should probably not even go into the same cateogry as concat or lookup
which really are functions.

I still have no idea how to name the categories :-).

Maybe it would be easier to get some nice grouping for the cheatsheet as this
is easier to look at in one piece and apply the same categories to the Wiki
later?

ciao,
  Torsten.

I think not if I understand the question
, because the answer to "Do 3 45? turns of a line in the axis make it a
space diagonal to that octant" is no.

It takes only two rotations, one of 45 and the other of atan(sqrt(0.5)) for
the reason you showed above.

cube(50, center = true);


hull() {

  sphere();


  rotate([0,-atan(sqrt(0.5)), 45])

     translate([100, 0, 0])

         sphere();

}

Thank you, atan is the function I was looking for.

After thinking about it, I have understood that it is not possible to rotate
a cube in the way I was visualizing. In that case you would need a different
shape than a cube.

side = 10;
side_half = side/2;
opposite_over_adjacent = side_half / (side_half*sqrt(2));

rotate([45, atan(opposite_over_adjacent), 0])
cube([side, side, side], center = true);

Side note:  The atan2 function may be (more) useful as it takes into
consideration the sign of the y & x values.

See

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Solved! (kinda) using openscad to export dxf files
Message-ID: <1421873634742-11188.post@n5.nabble.com>

if you want to slice your stl and use openscad to export them to a dxf format
then try this workflow

1. in Autodesk Meshmixer, go to Edit-> Align and select Type:AAbox
2. in Meshmixer go to Edit-> Make slices and select Method:Stacked 3D
3. in Meshmixer, select each slice and click Edit-> Make solid
4. Export each slice that has been converted to a solid as an stl file
(layer1_solid.stl, layer2_solid.stl, etc.)
5. In openscad, import your stl
6. use the following code

projection(cut=true)
translate([0,0,-z)
import("yourstl.stl");

Your z will be dependent on your stl file. To the best of my knowledge,
there is no module that will give you the origin of the stl file or place it
at the origin. I just experimented with different values. I believe aligning
the stl in Meshmixer will place the bottom of your stl at [0,0,0]

7. export to DXF!

The tricky part is that you can't iterate the process with a for loop.
Others have suggested running shell commands but my stl was small enough
where I could just do it manually.

There might be a better way to do this but this worked for me. Cheers

I have seen on multiple occasions, the snapshot boxes (the six in the windows

fixed with a refresh. May be related??

The version number is filled with JavaScript, so with NoScript plugin or
similar, it will show the "?".

The Linux nightly snapshot downloads come from the OpenSUSE build service.
We don't have much influence there. I've never seen the issue though.

ciao,

Try this:

hull() {
    cylinder(d=1,h=1,$fn=30);
    translate([-.5,-.5,-1]) cube(1);
}

Message-ID: <1422062546464-11201.post@n5.nabble.com>

hi,

trying to generate a large (25mm) screw, 9mm long, with a decent (between
the U.S. "national coarse" and "national fine") thread count.

if i use:
metric_thread(diameter=25, pitch=26, length=strsScrewLength, internal=false,
n_starts=1);
it fails (see below);

if i use:
metric_thread(25, 16, strsScrewLength);
it works.

if anyone has any advice, i'm all ears.
thanks

I get the OP's errors with 2014.03. And with just the metric_thread(25,26,9)

OK, the library, where the pitch >= diameter, gets n_turns=0, probably not
healthy.
It may take a while to understand what's happening. 
Perhaps, diameter=25, pitch=24 will do???

I have not been able to find what the associated cause is...

maybe due to previously highlighting text for a copy ie drag to select. ???


p.s. I still think DEPRICATED should not trigger the WARNING behaviour, as
it is sooo comon using libraries...

Message-ID: <1422138334656-11212.post@n5.nabble.com>

I don't think the computing gods want me to make a Sparc version of Openscad. 
I found a source for gar here:

# pkgutil -y -i gar_dev mgar gcc4core gcc4g++ sudo

but ran out of space in my root directory half way through.  I guess when I
set up the disk I wasn't anticipating needing to download half the content
of the Internet to compile Openscad.

So one backup/repartition/restore later, I managed to get gar and mgar in my
/opt/csw/bin/.  I ran the Qt5 make over again but still no gar/category.mk
on my system.  So I decided to punt that and try installing Qt 4.8.5
directly from opencsw.  But the makefile for that ALSO wants to include the
ephemerous gar/category.mk.  Apparently, that is to be found in
/opt/csw/src, another directory I don't have and can't find out how to get. 
I have /opt/csw, but no src.

Briefly, to get Openscad you need Qt.  To get Qt you need gar/category.mk. 
To get category.mk you need opt/csw/src.  And I see no instructions anywhere
on how to get that.

Since there are Linux versions of Openscad available, and since this prpblem
doesn't particularly seem to be Sparc or Solaris related, can someone please
tell me *what I need to do to get Qt installed???*  Pretty please?

There?s mention of being able to build the test suites without any QT:

https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Building_OpenSCAD_from_Sources#Library_notes <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Building_OpenSCAD_from_Sources#Library_notes>

I wonder if that could be leveraged to build a CLI-only variant of openscad (on Solaris), completely unencumbered by QT dependencies.?.

Thanks for the reply.  That sounds good.  I assume you're referring to this:
"As of mid 2013 it was possible to build the test suites entirely without
QT.".

Unfortunately they don't say *how* to do this.  And then further down they
say "OpenSCAD also needs tools like 'git', 'cmake', and ImageMagick."  Uh oh
- ImageMagick, OK, let's look it up.  Hmmm - 28 dependencies including the
memorable "Cairo bindings for Pango", which sounds like something from "The
Maltese Falcon".

So Openscad has 18 dependencies,  If each of those has 28 dependencies, that
means 504 packages to load.  And all those dependencies no doubt have their
own dependencies.  Honest to God I don't know how Openscad ever came into
existence at all in the first place.

The test framework doesn?t require Qt, and that basically builds a full OpenSCAD, just without a GUI, so if you just want to use it on the cmd-line this could work.
The docs are sketchy as this is meant only for developers, but here?s some info: https://github.com/openscad/openscad/blob/master/doc/testing.txt

Yes, you?ll likely need other dependencies.

OpenSCAD is Free Software, build on the shoulders of giants. Having lots of dependencies isn?t necessarily a huge problem. The challenge is to get it to work on bare-bones or really old systems.
I?m not opposed to replacing some of our dependencies with homegrown solutions, but we need more developers to develop and test those solutions.

Hi all,

Please consider the current master branch and snapshot binaries >= 2015.01.23 a Release Candidate of OpenSCAD 2015.02. 
For changes, please see https://github.com/openscad/openscad/blob/master/releases/2015.02.md

We?re planning to give it a week or so for testing before making a release, unless significant enough bugs or regressions surface, in which case the whole process will have to rinse and repeat until we?re content. 

Please give it a spin and pour your complaints here or on the github issue tracker. 

Thanks,

rotatev(deg_a, [x, y, z], v)

It would transform v into another vector which is rotated around the given
axis by the given number of degrees, as we are accustomed to. Even better if
it could take a list of vectors and rotate them all in the same manner.

This can be written as user code. But before I go and figure out the math
for myself, has anyone out there written it already?

I agree - we need to collect contact info to translators.

Translators: would you mind posting your name and contact info here? I?ll include that into a release checklist, similar to this:

Since we use HTML to provide the highlighting, perhaps there was some error output earlier which confused the Qt html parser?
It would be really helpful if you could manage to reproduce this.

Message-ID: <1422172275603-11223.post@n5.nabble.com>

Should be quite simple.  To do individual rotations on each axis would be
like this:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#In_three_dimensions
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#In_three_dimensions>  
function rotate(rv) =
[[1,0,0],[0,cos(rv[0]),-sin(rv[0])],[0,sin(rv[0]),cos(rv[0])]] *
[[cos(rv[1]),0,sin(rv[1])],[0,1,0],[-sin(rv[1]),0,cos(rv[1])]] *
[[cos(rv[2]),-sin(rv[2]),0],[sin(rv[2]),cos(rv[2]),0],[0,0,1]];
So to do arbitrary, you'd do this:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#Rotation_matrix_from_axis_and_angle
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#Rotation_matrix_from_axis_and_angle>  
identity = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]];function length(v) =
sqrt(pow(v[0],2)+pow(v[1],2)+pow(v[2],2));function unit_vector(v) =
[v[0]/length(v), v[1]/length(v), v[2]/length(v)];function uv(v) =
unit_vector(v);function rotate(a, v) = cos(a)*identity +
sin(a)*unit_vector(v) + cross((1 - cos(a))*unit_vector(v), unit_vector(v));
To join these together, you'd need a way to determine if a is an array. 
There are a few ways to do this, but there's no built in function that does
this definitively that I've found.  So I wrote my own that should work in
all cases:
// FUNCTION: is_String(x)//   Returns true if x is a string, false
otherwise.function is_string(x) =	x == undef || len(x) == undef		? false //
if undef, a boolean or a number		: len(str(x,x)) == len(x)*2; // if an
array, this is false// FUNCTION: is_array(x)//   Returns true if x is an
array, false otherwise.function is_array(x) = is_string(x) ? false : len(x)
!= undef;
With that you can join the two rotation functions like this:
function rotate(a, v) = is_vector(a)	?	 
[[1,0,0],[0,cos(a[0]),-sin(a[0])],[0,sin(a[0]),cos(a[0])]]		*
[[cos(a[1]),0,sin(a[1])],[0,1,0],[-sin(a[1]),0,cos(a[1])]]		*
[[cos(a[2]),-sin(a[2]),0],[sin(a[2]),cos(a[2]),0],[0,0,1]]	: cos(a)*identity
+ sin(a)*unit_vector(v) + cross((1 - cos(a))*unit_vector(v),
unit_vector(v));
To do this on a list of vectors, you'd use a  for loop
<http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#For_Loop> 
.
Hope that helps.A

Sorry, but I had changed the name of the functions mid-stream and forgot to
update them all.  The actual functions with matching comments are:
// FUNCTION: is_string(x)//   Returns true if x is a string, false
otherwise.function is_string(x) =	x == undef || len(x) == undef		? false //
if undef, a boolean or a number		: len(str(x,x)) == len(x)*2; // if an

!= undef;// FUNCTION: is_bool(x)//   Returns true if x is a boolean, false
otherwise.function is_bool(x) = is_string(x) ? false : str(x) == "true" ||
str(x) == "false";// FUNCTION: is_number(x)//   Returns true if x is a
number, false otherwise.function is_number(x) = x != undef && len(x) ==
undef && !is_bool(x);// FUNCTION: dim(x)//   Returns the number of
dimensions  that x has.  If scalar (number, boolean//   or string), it has 0
dimentions. Will search down 0th element in array //   till no more arrays
are found.function dim_impl(v,d=0) = is_string(v) ? d : is_array(v) ?
dim_impl(v[0],d+1) : d;function dim(v) = dim_impl(v);
Sorry for the inconvenience.

Oh, looks like I've not done vector algebra is a looooooooong time as I
didn't understand the notation.  For getting the arbitrary rotation, it
would look like this:
function identity(d)        = d == 0 ? 1 : [for(y=[1:d]) [for(x=[1:d]) x ==
y ? 1 : 0] ];function length(v)          = let(x=v[0], y=v[1], z=v[2])
sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z);function unit_vector(v)     = let(x=v[0], y=v[1],
z=v[2]) [x/length(v), y/length(v), z/length(v)];function skew_symmetric(v) 
= let(x=v[0], y=v[1], z=v[2]) [[0, -z, y], [z, 0, -x], [-y, x, 0]];function
tensor_product1(u) = let(x=u[0], y=u[1], z=u[2]) [[x*x, x*y, x*z], [x*y,
y*y, y*z], [x*z, y*z, z*z]];function rotate(a, v) = is_array(a)	?
let(rx=a[0], ry=a[1], rz=a[2])		  [[1, 0, 0],              [0, cos(rx),
-sin(rx)], [0, sin(rx), cos(rx)]]		* [[cos(ry), 0, sin(ry)],  [0, 1, 0],             
[-sin(ry), 0, cos(ry)]]		* [[cos(rz), -sin(rz), 0], [sin(rz), cos(rz), 0], 
[0, 0, 1]]	: let(uv=unit_vector(v))	  cos(a)*identity(3) +
sin(a)*skew_symmetric(uv) + (1 - cos(a))*tensor_product1(uv); 
If you'll note, I've updated my notation to the new one as it is more
flexible and I find clearer.  Make sure you download 2015.01.23 from the
development snapshots.  I didn't and didn't understand why some of the newer
features weren't working.
Also, you wanted:
rotatev(deg_a, [x, y, z], v) 
but I gave you
rotate(a, v)
To use the rotate function I stated, you would multiply the vector that
comes out of the rotate function.  I.e.
echo(rotate(90, [1,0,0]) * [1, 0, 0]);echo(rotate(90, [1,0,0]) * [0, 1,
0]);echo(rotate(90, [1,0,0]) * [0, 0, 1]);
would give you:
ECHO: [1, 0, 0]ECHO: [0, 0, 1]ECHO: [0, -1, 0]
If you want to do against a list of vectors, you'd do this:
echo([for(i=[[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]) rotate(90, [1,0,0]) * i ]);
which happens to be the same as:
echo([for(i=identity(3)) rotate(90, [1,0,0]) * i ]);
which would give you a similar result as before:
ECHO: [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, -1, 0]]
This language is new to me and I've learned quite a bit from answering this
question.  Hopefully I've not totally confused you in the process. o.O :)

The render time is probably at least double as it was before.  Can I
reinstall 2014.03 in a separate directory without breaking anything?  Also,
don't recall if there was even an option to do so.

Thanks,

At first I thought the same...I will do some comparative renders...

One I did with 2015.01.13 (unfortunately I cleaned up all the prior interim
versions) v's .23, .23 was noticeably slower, but sample of one is not
statistics...

I also check the memory use BTW.

Note: norm(v) is a built-in function for vectors of any dimension, so you can replace your length(v) function with it.

Cool.  And here I had figured out another way to compute the unit vector:
function length(v)          = sqrt(([v]*v)[0]);function unit_vector(v)     =
v/length(v);
:) I'll swap out my length(v) function for norm(v). Thanks.  Though I am a
little surprised that there's no unit(v) function.

As for cross(v), I know about it.  I used it in my first implementation
above when I thought that the x with a circle around it (
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n11233/e9dd9013ec300ceba41484dfc2c9a876.png>
) meant cross product. Did I miss a cross product in my functions somewhere? 
They appear to be working...

Can you share your design?
I know that we?re sometimes slower as we had to sacrifice some speed to ensure stability in some cases, but we might still be able to improve that.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Would be nice to have constraints/assertions on
	functions/modules.
Message-ID: <1422208242941-11237.post@n5.nabble.com>

When debugging, it would be valuable if I could say something like:
 1. function fn(x) = assert(dim(x) == 1) 2.  let(result = 3.   
[for(i=[1:len(x)]) 4.      if(i!=len(x)-1) 5.        assert(x[i] > x[i-1],
str("@i==",i,".  Was ", x[i], " > ", x[i-1], ".")) 6.        x[i]-x[i-1] 7.   
]) 8.    assert(result[0] == 0) assert(len(x) == len(result)+1) result;
Please note that this is quite contrived example, but it demonstrates a
function's precondition, postcondition and an interior straight up
assertion.   Also, I've placed line numbers prior to each line of code and
we'll pretend that all lines shown here are in a file called x.scad.
This function shows that it takes only a one dimensional array, where each
element must be less than the one before it and the result must have a first
element be equal to 0 and have one less element then the array passed in.
The result itself is an array where the next element is subtracted from the
current.
If the assert's first parameter is equivalent to false, then it should the
file and line where the assertion occurred, as well as the caller's line all
the way up the stack.  Variables are substituted for the parameters with
their values to help in the debugging process.  This would be great to be
able to trace back where the problem came from.  It would also write out the
1st parameter as a string as well as the result that it gave back. This is
because false can be represented in many different ways and may be useful
when debugging.  Something like:
20. x=1;21. y=fn(x);
Would output:
ASSERTION FAILURE  -> from file x.scad:21 while calling: fn(1)  -> in file
x.scad:1  (dim(x) == 1) == false
If an assert has a 2nd parameter, it should evaluate and output that as well
as the programmer can drop a more explicit hint as to what the user of their
function did wrong. So something like this:
34. fn([4,undef,3]);
Would output:
ASSERTION FAILURE  -> from x.scad:2 while calling: fn([4,undef,3])  -> in
file x.scad:5  (x[i] < x[i+1]) == undef  @i==0.  Was 4 < undef.
An assert can be placed anywhere prior to an expression and if false, then
should stop the execution in its tracks.  An assert is not an expression, it
doesn't return any value and must be bound to an expression.  That said,
multiple asserts can be placed next to each other, so they all would be
bound to the expression to the right of the rightmost assert.
Alternatives would be to have specific pre and postcondition constraints as
well as assertions, but I don't think that it would be that great of a gain.
Also, instead of just using the 2nd parameter, we could just use the 2nd on
and treat them as if they were parameters to the str(...) function which
would remove the need for the call to str(...) which might reduce the
typing, but may increase the noise as assert value and assert message can
run together.  If done this way, one could still do it the other way and
could be left up to the preference of the programmer of the .scad file.
I think the usefulness to the programmer and user of any .scad library would
benefit. What do you ppl think?

Remember that each line is a rotation matrix, one for each axis, multiplied
together to make the final matrix. But thanks. :)

Message-ID: <1422210693582-11241.post@n5.nabble.com>

Is there a reason to have /hidden/ parameters?

Which gives me:

This is ok at least as it is pointed out that 'value' was used but not
defined.  But in this case:

It give this:

I would think that this could be a source of bugs as someone may pass a
parameter by name and if the parameter name doesn't exist it would continue
on it's merry way using a variable that was defined somewhere else in the
file causing hard to find bugs.

Also, is there a way of putting out filenames and line numbers where the
warning occurred?

Message-ID: <1422211484418-11242.post@n5.nabble.com>

It is a bit scary that a user defined function can override a preexisting one
without some override keyword.  Especially if the language is growing and it
is possible that someone may define a function that is used in another
library which might cause unexpected results or if a user defines their own
function without realising that they had already defined it already.

Perhaps an override keyword could be added to indicate intent?  And without
it cause an error on compile?

Thanks,

What is needed more is a way to call the built-in functions & modules [ie
cube() difference() etc] if they have been redefined. Or maybe call the next
lower version on the stack, thus having cascadable re-definitions. Sort of
like FORTH IIRC.

That would make it possible to override the default behavior.

(assuming the syntax is & to mean call the built-in)

module cube(v3,center) { // stupid example - all non centered cubes are red.
  if (!center)
    color("red")
      &cube(v3,true)
  else
    &cube(v3,false);
}

It might not be easy to cover all in the first go as the line
number tracking is very limited currently. That's a big issue
that needs to be solved in itself.

Why tie it to an expression, just to make it usable at any place
where an expression can be used right now? It probably is useful
in a module context too, e.g.

module m() {
	assert(...);

	...
}

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Weird 'close' behaviour on OSX
Message-ID: <1422263292770-11245.post@n5.nabble.com>

I've been using 01.05 until now but I noticed this morning that 01.23 is
being considered as an RC with only a week for review so I wanted to throw
this out there in case it's a bug whilst I investigate further.

I tend to work with multiple files open across multiple virtual desktops
(Spaces, or whatever it's called these days) and I open and close down
windows as I need them. I noticed recently that sometimes if I do Command-W
to close a window, then select the appropriate option (save or don't save)
on the "This document has been modified" dialog, OpenSCAD *sometimes* gets
stuck in one of the following scenarios:

* Window is closed, but now OpenSCAD doesn't switch to one of my other open
windows (shows "OpenSCAD" in the menu but no other menu options)
* Window doesn't close but now OpenSCAD blocks me from activating on of my
other open windows

It's not as simple as 'always when I click save' and I haven't done enough
testing yet to track down the exact sequence of events that causes it. Has
anybody else noticed anything similar? I'll upgrade to 01.23 now and see if
it still occurs.

This is interesting.  I would like your __pre(), __post(), __doc() and
__test() decorators to be implemented.  However, the assert() that I propose
/*should*/ be easier to implement as it probably could piggyback off of how
let() was done and could be used in the interim for the pre and post
decorator conditions you propose without being as big as a discussion.

I think these may be different issues.
I can sometimes reproduce the first, but not in debug mode - it feels like a Qt issue.

In terms of the second one; you say the window _doesn?t_ close and also blocks other windows? If you manage to reproduce that, it would be very helpful!

Really?  Hmmm. Ok, then that could be postponed for a later time.  How about
the rest of the output that I stated?  Would that be possible?  And the text
that an assert outputs could be still used for a person to do a find in the
code at least.

Tieing it to an expression was meant for coding simplicity (of modifying the
SCAD parser) since there is already a let() function, it could be
implemented in the same manner which is known to work.

This would still allow it to be put into a module (abit somewhat hackily) by
putting it in the first or in a fake assignment.  The assert() idea I had
was mostly for testing near the point of need, but it could be expanded to a
module scope as well.  In fact, if we have it as I suggest, one could make a
module that is called assert() and use the hack.  I.e.

My analysis uncovered a few things which trigger differences vs. OpenSCAD-2014.03:

1) Your ?end cylinders? are duplicated. These overlapping geometries causes very small differences in coordinates causing a lot more vertices to be created, and thus longer calculation time
2) When you connect the arm elements together, you put them together so they _exactly_  touch each other. Since ?exactly? doesn?t exist in floating point, there?s a chance for a small crack to form. This happens in the latest dev snapshot and, again, causes more geometry to be created. It?s recommended to have a tiny overlap between such components.

I think that if you fix those two issues, the rendering times should be comparable.

We aim to handle such issues better in the future.
The reason why it worked better in 2014.03 was that we did some aggressive snapping of vertices to a grid. Unfortunately, that cause other geometries to break in more serious ways.

Try this.

Run fresh OpenSCAD

create a syntax error (do not save - so it autosaves a backup)
F5 - gets error msg
select any part or all of the first console line (above the error highlight)
& part of the error msg.
F5 again, whole console should be hightlighted
Fix error
F5 whole console highlighted.

Thanks Marius,

Yeah, I was being lazy about the cylinders.  I'll fix that.   As for the arm
elements exactly touching, how much overlap should I do?  0.001mm?  I'll use
a constant and come back to this thread later.

Thanks again,

One other thing that I noticed in 2015 is that if a module doesn't exist and
you call it, it doesn't report a 'warning'.  I'm not sure why a warning was
used in the previous one, I would think it should be an error and just bail,
but at least that was better than not reporting anything like the 2015 RC
does.  I found that out when I mistyped translate(). :(

Thanks,

Subject: [OpenSCAD] How to create an cylindrical arc?
Message-ID: <1422405038898-11257.post@n5.nabble.com>

I need to make an cylindrical arc given 3 points: start, middle and end. 
It's been a while since I've done vector algebra, but I'm guessing I'll have
to find the centre point which I would use to translate from the origin,
find the plane, which I would use to rotate from the x,y plane to the actual
plane, find the radius and extrude several linear segments of a circle and
then rotate and translate it into position.

Does that sound reasonable?  Is there another way to do this?  A prefabbed
lib maybe?

Actually, is it "cheaper" to make a bunch of segments and subtract the

segments?

I think the short answer is you can't, you would need to leave a small gap.
If you don't you are describing a single shape.

There is no concept of materials in OpenScad. It just describes solid
shapes.

Actually, I think that doing a bunch of segments wouldn't work since every
time I add a new segment, it would not properly intersect with the last one. 
I would need some type of function to "round the corner" between one segment
and the next. :(

So I guess that answers my question.  Unless there is some other way to make
an arc.  Unfortunately, it looks like rotate_extrude() is limited to only
doing a full 360 degrees and no partial.  At least the documentation doesn't
seem to indicate that it is possible...

Nice little conversation you're having with yourself ;)

Try donutslice() from MCAD/2Dshapes.scad, in libraries under your OpenSCAD
program installation directory. You'll need to extrude it.

You should checkout all the MCAD libraries too.

Cheers.

Yeah, smth. like that.

Eventually I think we should look into snapping such elements together. Just don?t want to second-guess any design decisions..

Does this happen all the time? You should get a warning. We even made such warnings more visible in the new version.
See screenshot for how it should look. If you don?t see this you may have found a bug : /

I don't believe so, not programmatically in a .scad, you could export to stl
and look in the stl. or dxf??

If your going to do that, have a look at  dxf_dim() etc
<https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/General>   (down the
bottom). I have never used it.

I had that warning when I was overlapping two things of the same shape too
exactly or when faces matched too exactly.  Try putting some in some overlap
for faces and remove objects that overlap each other 100%.

Documentation is sparse on donutSlice().  From what I can see, it makes a
blocky donut slice.  Not very useful. :/

I've done things like this in the past (to make a tubular arc in the case
below) by doing a rotate_extrude (to make a torus) and finding the
intersection of that and a wedge shape made by linear_extruding a sort of
fanning polygon that starts at the centre of the rotation and expands
around the outside of  the torus.  You could probably adapt that to your
needs.
$fn=64;

pipebend (4,3,20,135);

module pipebend (thickness, id, od, ang)
intersection (){
   difference(){
torus (thickness, od);
torus (id,od);
        }
   wedge (thickness, (od+thickness)/1.7,ang);
   }
// ********************** End of Module ******************



module torus (thickness, dia,)
rotate_extrude(convexity = 10) translate([dia/2, 0, 0]) circle(r =
thickness/2) ;
// ********************** End of Module ******************



module wedge (thickness, rad, ang)
translate ([0,0,-(thickness/2)-1]) {
linear_extrude (height = thickness+2) {
polygon(points=[
[rad*cos(ang/2),-rad*sin(ang/2)],
[0,0],
[rad*cos(ang/2),rad*sin(ang/2)],
[rad*cos(ang/3),rad*sin(ang/3)],
[rad*cos(ang/6),rad*sin(ang/6)],
[rad,0],
[rad*cos(ang/6),-rad*sin(ang/6)],
[rad*cos(ang/3),-rad*sin(ang/3)]],
paths=[[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]]);}
}
// ********************** End of Module ******************

The two boxes should touch each other and the new points should be

What do you mean exactly by new points and contact face?

You can calculate pretty much any shape with OpenScad but you would have to
render one piece at a time and export them separately if you want them to be
separate objects that touch each other or intersect each other. There is no
physical reality to objects that intersect or share a common boundary. 

You could calculate the rectangle where the cubes touch by overlapping them
slightly and doing the intersection and then projecting that to 2D. The
contact face isn't a 3D solid because it has no thickness. OpenScad can only
represent 3D solids or 2D shapes, not a 2D square floating in 3D space. That
is why you would need to overlap to get a valid 3D intersection with an
arbitrary thickness that you can then flatten to 2D.

If you need access to the points of a 2d (or 3d) object than write your own
routines that create e.g. the points of a circle and write your  own
plotting routine as well.

Somewhat like this:

fn=16;


// create 2d vector shape: circle

function circv(r=1,fn=32)=

[for(i=[0:fn-1])

[r*cos(360*i/fn),r*sin(360*i/fn)]

];


// create 2d vector shape: star

function starv(r1=1,r2=2,fn=32)=

[for(i=[0:(2*fn-1)])

(i%2==0)?

[r1*cos(180*i/fn),r1*sin(180*i/fn)]:

[r2*cos(180*i/fn),r2*sin(180*i/fn)]

];


// display a 2d vector shape

module dispv(v){

indi=[[for(i=[0:len(v)-1])i]];

polygon(points=v,paths=indi);

}


v0=starv(10,20,fn);

dispv(v0);

echo("circle",v0);


v1=circv(10,fn);

translate([40,0,0])dispv(v1);

echo("star",v1);

Well that's less blocky but its too big and I also want a circle extruded
along an arc.  I've been looking around and it looks like sweep() is what
I'm looking for, but I need to figure out how it works and where all the
modules are to use it.  I see it  here
<https://github.com/openscad/list-comprehension-demos>  , but some of the
modules it includes are not there.

Sweep is a bit general and probably requires too much configuration to fit your needs perfectly.
Currently, the best solution I can think of is to just intersect your 360 degree rotation volume with a wedge.
Here?s a quick starting point:

module rotate_extrude_angle(angle, size) {
  module pie(a) {
    r=sqrt(2);
    hull() polyhedron(points=[[0,0,-r], [r,0,-r], [r*cos(a),r*sin(a),-r],[0,0,r], [r,0,r], [r*cos(a),r*sin(a),r]], faces=[[0,1,2,3,4,5]]);
  }

  intersection() {
    scale(size) pie(angle);
    rotate_extrude() children();
  }
}

rotate_extrude_angle(45, 13) translate([8,0]) circle(5);

This has been discussed earlier and it?s on the roadmap.
Some related resources:
o https://github.com/openscad/openscad/wiki/Multi-material-support
o https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/350
o https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/1041
o https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/1044

The way to do it today is to enable/disable features and export multiple times, e.g. using a script.
I did a 5-color test object this way, see:

Yep, quick and dirty. the rotate_extrude() needs a convexity parameter to render correctly. I guess we could be helpful and automatically set it higher for rotate_extrude as it tends to always have a depth complexity of minimum 2..

Ive done a few like theses, I use a pie library.
It can slide up a circle easy enough, and then a difference of a another
pie. Pretty easy.

You need the development version to use it.

And where do I get that?  I have the 2015.01.23.  Isn't that development?


> too big and I also want a circle extruded along an arc. 

IOW a curved tube??

Yes.

Your cube and bars has co-incident faces.

Always overlap joins by a small amount or separate edges similarly, in the
below I just made the cube a fraction bigger.

length=165;
width=42;

smidgen=0.05;
// Flexible mat
rotate([0,0,-45])
translate([-smidgen,-smidgen,0])
cube([width+smidgen*2,length+smidgen*2,0.3]);

// Slats
for ( i = [0:(length/2.121)] ) {
  translate([i*1.5,i*1.5,0])
  rotate([90,0,45])
  linear_extrude(width)
  polygon(points=[[0,0],[0.3,1.2],[1.3,1.2],[1.6,0]]);
}

// Handle
rotate([0,0,-45]) {
  translate([width/2,4,0]) {
    difference() {
      union() {
        translate([-4,0,0])
        cylinder(r=4,h=5,$fn=40);
    
        translate([4,0,0])
        cylinder(r=4,h=5,$fn=40);
    
        translate([0,0,2.5])
        rotate(0,0,0)
        cube([8,8,5],center=true);
      }
  
      translate([0,8,8])
      rotate([0,90,0])
      cylinder(r=7.8,h=30,$fn=40,center=true);
    
      translate([0,-8,8])
      rotate([0,90,0])
      cylinder(r=7.8,h=30,$fn=40,center=true);
    }
  }

I have managed to get this to happen again in 01.23, but only after working
with multiple files open for a long time. I still can't lock it down to an
exact sequence of steps though. :(

Coincidentally, it feels a LOT like the situation described in the latest
XKCD cartoon: http://xkcd.com/1479/
- I'm pretty sure there aren't any modal dialogs open anywhere though
(unless it just failed to close the one that is asking me if I want to save
before closing).

hello dear colleagues :)

I currently work for one of the world leaders in CAD engineering company and
have an access to all their proprietory software aimed to repairing,
validating, etc of STL files. It works drastically better than any of known
solutions for me (like netfabb, ms modelrepair, emendo, etc) so if anyone
want me to help - just ask me here or in PM.

Indeed, I can't guarantee an immediate result (as I'm doing it in my spare
time) but I can assure the result will be amazing ))

.. just my 2 cents to help the 3d printing progress )))

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Progress bar feedback
Message-ID: <1422540691471-11298.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi there,

The OpenSCAD progress bar does not have a xxx/1000 on a mac like it does on
windows. It would be nice if it did, in fact is there a way to provide some
form of feedback. I recently waited 56 hours for a model not to render, the
progress bar was stuck about 30% of the way along. In other instances it
gets most of the way along and stops. I'm guessing it is running up and down
some trees somewhere, but it would be nice if there was a status window
progress could actually be reported into, or the progress bar scaled
accordingly.

It much know how many tasks and sub-tasks need doing, and I'd be gutted if I
was 8 seconds away from the 56 hour render just completing.

It would be great if I could get to the Export menu item via keyboard.  I
know you mac users don't care so much as the menu isn't accessible via
keyboard (that I'm aware of), but as a windows and X-Window user, I get
really irritated when I can't just do something like Alt,F,E,S to export to
STL, especially when all of the keys are there except for E for Export. GAH!
:/

In fact, it would be nice to have keys for most, if not all, menu items. 
It's a little thing, but a great thing.

This has been discussed earlier (http://forum.openscad.org/The-recent-talk-on-Accessibility-had-me-look-at-menus-td7320.html), but it didn?t get updated. I?ve gone through the menus and updated all mnemonics, so this is fixed in the latest master.

If you?re in a position to build OpenSCAD, please give it a spin. Otherwise, wait a few days for the next update.

This is a known issue:
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/810

It?s hard to properly fix as we use a library which keeps us in the dark for a long time.
56 hours is a bit brutal - optimizing this is high on the wishlist too..

Thanks for your offer!

I?m currently using some repair tools to repair certain types of issues as part of diagnosing why OpenSCAD won?t import certain types of files.
I?m struggling with one particular user-submitted design:

Original: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:81182/#files
Fixed by Netfabb: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:131701/#files

The fixed design still doesn?t import into OpenSCAD because it contains ?zero triangles?, i.e. triangles where all vertices lie on the same line, meaning it doesn?t have area and thus no normal vector.

MeshLab can fix this using Filters->Cleaning and Repairing->Remove T-vertices by EdgeFlip
However, MeshLab crashes when trying to repair this model.

Does your software have such a feature? If so, it would be cool if you could give it a spin.
The goal would be to get this to render in OpenSCAD, and understand what had to be fixed to make this work:

import( "actual_tardis.stl" );
translate( [ -100, -100, 0 ] ) cube( [ 200, 200, 0.5 ] );

Cheers,

 -Marius

I think I managed to run into the same issue. It don?t think it was related to closing windows though.
It also happened after working with multiple designs over some time.
It looks like we lose all input events, leaving the application unresponsive.
It suspiciously looks like a Qt bug. Qt-5.4.1 is just around the corner. Perhaps that would help.

Anyway, if you find more indicators what could be wrong, please post it.
..and _when_ it happens, could you try to mess around a bit to see if you can get _any_ output from the app, things like window resizing, opening files using the ?open? command etc.?

We don?t yet have a 3D offset function, so shells must be made through
creative use of minkowski.
This will be very very slow, but here?s a starting point (based on the 3D
morphology at
https://github.com/openscad/scad-utils/blob/master/morphology.scad):

module outset(d) {
   minkowski() {
       sphere(d);
       children();
   }
}

module inset(d) {
   inverse() outset(d) inverse() children();
}

module shell(d) {
   difference() {
       children();
       inset(d) children();
   }
}

module inverse() {
   difference() {
       cube(100,center=true);
       children();
   }
}

shell(2) cube(10);

Do you think the low performance is intrinsic to this type of problem, or is
a problem with the library?

I?m pretty sure that the library (CGAL) doesn?t optimize this problem properly.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] ALPHA: New Text Module Based on Technical Lettering Style
Message-ID: <1422579455985-11310.post@n5.nabble.com>

I've put together a simple text module for OpenSCAD which draws letters using
the simple lettering style of technical drawings.  I got about halfway done
when I realized there are other, better solutions for text.  But I decided
to finish it anyway, and make it available in case it proves helpful to
anyone.  This is my first OpenSCAD project, so I expect there will be
mistakes in style and format, if not functionality.  Feedback welcome.

The module can be found here:

Even though I appreciate the typographical effort and I'll surelly read
your routines since I share the enthusiasm in the usage of OpenSCAD in this
field of computer graphics.

Thanks kintel,

I'm pretty busy at the moment with work and life, so I'll wait till the
build comes out.  But if you could tell me or point me in the direction of
how to build on a Windows system, I'd be interested in learning. :)

No, I'll probably have to be doing some transforms to get it to the right
location.  Would be nice to just say arc(begin, middle, end, diameter) or
something of that nature and just have it done, but there's nothing out
there now.  I'll probably programme its API that way.

I usually abbreviate to s & s2...saves typing, I believe epsilon is the more
technically correct term.

please find repaired STL file and two pictures showing the state of the stl
file before and after repair. The main problem on this file was engraving.
All the letters where not correct that I decided to delete all the places.
That includes those letters. Due to the fact that the lettering can be done
in a separate files in any CAD system with the correct representation it
does not make too much sense to repair them all (more than 2000).

Sorry, I don't mean any offense, but deleting bits as not a particularly good
'fix'. I could have done than in my original attempt.

But thanks for trying...

This was a very quick fix in order to get some of the geometry fixed. As we show on the picture the most erroneous areas are where the text is engraved. We can get rid of all the errors but that will take some time or made a copy of the ext elements in CAD system, create an triangulated correct representation than put it back to the main STL. In this scenario time needed for all correction its minimized min. If we try to fix the original STL as it is it can take hours. The intersections and overlaps, especially that extremely big makes automatic repair almost impossible. Hope you understand )

I've just written this code that creates a gear based on different
parameters. I just posted it here to see if anyone has any suggestions for
improvements or extra details I can add. Also I thought that someone might
benefit from this if they aren't able to make a gear themselves.

Basically, what do you think? How can this be improved? And enjoy!

Teeth need to be involutes (think of trapezoids warped along the circle that
forms the circular pitch of the gear).

And have a look at https://github.com/openscad/MCAD/blob/dev/gears/involute_gears.scad.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Connect planes with corresponding vertices
Message-ID: <1422644509930-11326.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi everyone

I have a really complex (for me) problem that I can't seem to solve. It is a
subproblem of an attempt to extrude a 2d shape along a bezier curve.

I have a list of (programmatically generated) polygons stored as vectors,
shown below.

poly1 = [
    [0,0,0],
    [0, 40,  0],
    [30, 20, 0],
    [50, 30, 0],
    [50, 0, 0]
];

poly2 = [
    [0,0,10],
    [0, 50,  10],
    [30, 30, 10],
    [50, 20, 10],
    [50, 0, 10]
];

shape = [poly1, poly2, ..., polyN];

What I want is to make these into a solid shape. poly1 forms the bottom,
polyN forms the top, the edges of the rest work to define the walls of the
polygons.

The number of vertices in all polygons is the same, in this example 5 (in
the real world a lot higher).
And the vertices are corresponding (ie the first vertex of first polygon is
to be connected with the first of the second, see below.) The z coordinate
is always the same for all vertices in each polygon. So a list of flat
faces.

Perhaps a picture makes it more clear. I have drawn in a few triangles in
red and blue. Essentially the whole shape should be covered by them to make
a solid.

        linear_extrude(height=height)
        polygon([for (i=face) [ i[0], i[1] ] ]);
}

// debug 
for (i=planes) {
    plane_extrude(i);
}


On side note, it would be nice if echo() formatted vectors differently when
they are nested. For example by printing each sub-vector on a new line.


Have a nice day,

In pseudo-code:

delta=0.1;
hull() {
  for(pt=poly1){ 
    translate(pt) sphere(r=delta);
  }
  for(pt=poly2){
    translate(pt) sphere(r=delta);
  }
}

...or some variation on that, use hull() to fill the gap. You may have to subdivide your polys into sets of to/from triangle pairs to handle concave regions.

Splitting up the polygons to handles concave regions was a good idea. Apart
from that that I'm not quite sure what you're suggesting here (I'll take a
closer look). In general I can't use hull() because the polygons are
concave. If I split my polygons into convex regions and use hull() I don't
see where the spheres come in.

:)

Assuming points are nearest-neighbour ordered and len(poly1)==len(poly2), the
following may serve your purpose:

I see what you're doing now, and indeed it was my first attempt (except I
used linear extrude() instead of spheres).

It doesn't work with concave objects. And frankly I think subdividing the
polygons is more work than solving the problem directly.

Indeed I had some code for the simplest case (only two polygons "hulled"
together) that I thought was working perfectly, until I tried it on
different polygons and found all the faces to be inside out, and some
structural problems.

Code:

poly1 = [
    [0,0,0],
    [0, 40,  0],
    [30, 20, 0],
    [50, 30, 0],
    [50, 0, 0]
];

poly2 = [
    [0,0,10],
    [0, 50,  10],
    [30, 30, 10],
    [50, 20, 10],
    [50, 0, 10]
];

plane1 = [
        [-1, 0, 0], [125, 0, 0], [125, 235, 0], [125, 235, 0], [125.162,

Thanks, that looks almost like what i have, only better, as it fixed the
inside out bottom face.

Either we both made some mistake, or my input polygons are somehow broken
(plane1 and 2 from my previous post).

That was part of all that testing posts a while ago.It has been partially
fixed, but you need to check the 'Message is in HTML Format' box.I have,
slowly, looked into setting that as default, so far I have found a way for
individuals to set that, but am hoping there is a way to do it for a Nabble
group (or whatever they are called). Nabble's NAML languare is 'different'
and not well documented - if anyone knows a good resource please let me
know. (testing again...)

Turns out the input data was a little bit broken. All faces clockwise and an
duplicated vertex. However, I still get these mysterious purple "flaps".

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n11334/gullwing.png> 

Code:

poly1 = [[-1.0,312.0,0.0],

[171.0,312.0,0.0],
[136.375,284.0,0.0],

[125.0,235.0,0.0],
[125.0,0.0,0.0],
//[-1.0,0.0,0.0]
];

poly2 = [[-1.0,312.0,30.0],

[191.624,312.0,30.0],

[145.624,235.0,30.0],
[145.624,0.0,30.0],
//[-1.0,0.0,30.0]
];

for (i=[0:-1+len(poly1)] ) color([1, i*0.1, 0]) translate(poly1[i])
sphere(r=5);
for (i=[0:-1+len(poly2)] ) color([0, i*0.1, 1]) translate(poly2[i])
sphere(r=5);
    
poly1to2=concat(poly1,poly2);
echo(poly1to2);
poly1to2_faces=[ [for(i=[len(poly1)-1:-1:0]) i]
    ,[for(j=[len(poly1):len(poly1)+len(poly2)-1]) j]
        ];
poly1to2_faces_between1=[for(k=[0:len(poly1)-1]) [k,k+1,k+len(poly1)]];
poly1to2_faces_between2=[for(k=[0:len(poly1)-1])
[k+len(poly1),k+len(poly1)-1,k]];

You need a development snapshot for that to work. Sounds like you?re on 2014.03 or earlier.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] reverse() and operator for concat()?
Message-ID: <1422657352071-11336.post@n5.nabble.com>

It would make sense for a function like this to be included as standard:

//      reverse a(a)
//      reverse the order of the elements in the vector a
function reverse (a, i=0) =
    len(a) > i ?
        concat(a[i],  reverse(a, i+1)) :
        []
;

And wouldn't it be good to have an operator for concat? Something like &, ++
or @. Of course not every function can get its own operator.

function reverse (a, i=0) =
    len(a) > i ?
        a[i] ++ reverse(a, i+1) :
        []
;

We?re still discussing having a new, more clean standard library.

It could be useful. We?ve been holding back a bit on operators, but this is indeed a possibility.

I see. Simply distributing scad-utils in the openscad package could be a
start.

This is common. The process of merging all your individual components into one single solid shape is computationally expensive and unfortunately we use an external library which doesn?t provide much progress info,
We plan to slightly improve this, but this won?t affect the processing time: https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/810

Fixing the processing time issue is also in the pipeline, but it?s a larger job.

That?s the goal, but we need to work more on the API. Some of this is already done in the MCAD dev-branch, but it?s still undecided how/when to get that into OpenSCAD proper.

Just to clarify: Is your problem that the tessellation of the concave endcaps is not correct? ..or are your experiencing other issues?

The endcap issue is a bug and will be fixed. I?ll open an issue.

Looks like an instance of this:

One workaround: add any other object to your scene and render using F6.

I'm at my whits end. What Shapeways is seeing wrong with my model has no 
place in what I designed. Where do they see this problem and why is it 
there?
The jpeg came attached with the shapeways message. The octa3.scad is my 
code that I used to generate the STL I've uploaded to shapeways. The STL 
is big, 57Mega. The rendering of the 5th order fractal takes a long time.

I'm writing to the list not really to ask for help, because having 
anyone wait for this to render overnight only to seek the needle in the 
haystack is too much to ask. But I am writing merely to express 
frustration with openscad/shapeways combination. I for one don't know 
how to go about finding what went wrong. Am I missing something?

Here are some details to help you resolve this issue:

  * Reason: Thin Wires
  * Description: The areas noted in the attached picture are too thin to
    withstand our manufacturing process without breaking.

    Our ?Strong and Flexible? materials are printed with a process known
    as selective laser sintering. The product is a composition of
    hundreds of microscopic layers melted together by a laser and
    suspended in an unmelted fine powder. We remove the solid models
    from the loose powder by hand and use sandblasting and compressed
    air equipment to achieve a fully cleaned surface.

    When the product is encased in loose powder it is similar to as if
    it were encased in a snow bank. The loose powder can at times be
    tough or difficult to remove. To avoid breaking your product in this
    stage, it is important that models are sturdy enough to be lifted
    and support the weight of excess powder while it is being cleaned.

    In your model, the areas pictured are at risk of breaking as the
    structure is too thin to withstand the weight of the loose powder
    around them, or the pressure needed to clean your product. The
    design may be more successful if the broken areas are thickened.

    We encourage you to iterate on your design to ensure a quality
    print. Please consider:
    1. Thickening the shown thin areas of your model, and giving it
    another once over for other potentially thin areas.
    2. Using our Wall Thickness checker! When you upload a model you
    will see a 3D view of your model with potentially thin areas shown
    in yellow.
    3. Ordering this model in a material with smaller minimum requirements
    4. Reordering this model in the current material with "Print It
    Anyway" selected, in which case we will print this model trying our
    best to avoid damaging it. If breakages occur, we?ll ship your
    product ?as is? and encourage you to iterate on your design for a
    more robust product.

    If you intend to order or sell this model in a dyed or polished
    material either now or in the future, please also consider that
    these areas must be strong enough to withstand our polishing
    procedure as well. This involves several hours in an industrial
    sized rotary vibrator under the weight of thousands of small ceramic
    pellets.
    Find additional information in the attached image.

I'm at my whits end. What Shapeways is seeing wrong with my model has no 
place in what I designed. Where do they see this problem and why is it 
there?
The jpeg came attached with the shapeways message. The octa3.scad is my 
code that I used to generate the STL I've uploaded to shapeways. The STL 
is big, 57Mega. The rendering of the 5th order fractal takes a long time.

I'm writing to the list not really to ask for help, because having 
anyone wait for this to render overnight only to seek the needle in the 
haystack is too much to ask. But I am writing merely to express 
frustration with openscad/shapeways combination. I for one don't know 
how to go about finding what went wrong. Am I missing something?

Here are some details to help you resolve this issue:

   * Reason: Thin Wires
   * Description: The areas noted in the attached picture are too thin to
     withstand our manufacturing process without breaking.

     Our ?Strong and Flexible? materials are printed with a process known
     as selective laser sintering. The product is a composition of
     hundreds of microscopic layers melted together by a laser and
     suspended in an unmelted fine powder. We remove the solid models
     from the loose powder by hand and use sandblasting and compressed
     air equipment to achieve a fully cleaned surface.

     When the product is encased in loose powder it is similar to as if
     it were encased in a snow bank. The loose powder can at times be
     tough or difficult to remove. To avoid breaking your product in this
     stage, it is important that models are sturdy enough to be lifted
     and support the weight of excess powder while it is being cleaned.

     In your model, the areas pictured are at risk of breaking as the
     structure is too thin to withstand the weight of the loose powder
     around them, or the pressure needed to clean your product. The
     design may be more successful if the broken areas are thickened.

     We encourage you to iterate on your design to ensure a quality
     print. Please consider:
     1. Thickening the shown thin areas of your model, and giving it
     another once over for other potentially thin areas.
     2. Using our Wall Thickness checker! When you upload a model you
     will see a 3D view of your model with potentially thin areas shown
     in yellow.
     3. Ordering this model in a material with smaller minimum requirements
     4. Reordering this model in the current material with "Print It
     Anyway" selected, in which case we will print this model trying our
     best to avoid damaging it. If breakages occur, we?ll ship your
     product ?as is? and encourage you to iterate on your design for a
     more robust product.

     If you intend to order or sell this model in a dyed or polished
     material either now or in the future, please also consider that
     these areas must be strong enough to withstand our polishing
     procedure as well. This involves several hours in an industrial
     sized rotary vibrator under the weight of thousands of small ceramic
     pellets.
     Find additional information in the attached image.

I have yet to look at your code in detail, but do a F5, then
view/thrown-together, the triangles are inside out.

This F5 shows me the negation of the original. Definitely did not expect 
that... Still it gave me a point of view and I shall explore. Maybe I 
_can_ eliminate some errors. Thanx. BTW, the view/thrown-together, just 
shows me the convex hull, not too revealing.... the view/OpenCSG is the 
most revealing one...

I'm getting more and more frustrated. The attached code, modified from 
before, do a F5, view as Open CSG. If you are like me, you'll see 2 gray 
objects, one a collection of intersecting tetrahedrons, the other a 
collection of cylinders. However, I see a couple of green stray green 
cylinders somewhere inside the tetrahedrons, and one stray green 
tetrahedron inside the cylinders object. By all mathematics, this should 
not happen. The code generates the shapes in fractal manner. I would 
expect uniformity (no cylinders in tetrahedrons, no tetrahedron in 
cylinders). Given that the unexpected happens, no wonder my model 
doesn't come out right.
I'll try to attach a pic too...

I'm using OpenSCAD <http://www.openscad.org>version 2014.03 on a linux 
64 (Fedora 20).

I don't know what an endcap is, but those things highlighted in pink in the
concave region shouldn't be there at all. That's my problem.

By adding a cube(1); after the skin call() the problem is corrected,
however, the shape now lacks the two large faces:

skin([poly1, poly2]);
cube(1);

Well that depends what your usage will be.

(1) For the virtual world, a non-involute shape will work fine.

(2) For the physical world, it can be no doubt maked to 'work', at least for a 
little while, especially if it is carrying virtually no load and the spacings 
can be iterated until they mesh and one has little concern for noise or life 
time of the gears.

(3) For the physical world with a real load, maybe not so much :-)

Nice description at wikipedia:

Well, one down, hopefully.  After spending a week trying (unsuccessfully) to
compile Qt5, I managed to locate a pre-built package of Qt4.5.3 here 
http://bwachter.lart.info/sfw.xp/ <http://bwachter.lart.info/sfw.xp/>   and
amazingly it claims to have installed successfully.

However, when I run scripts/check-dependencis.sh, it can't find it.  It's
installed in /opt/aard/qt4/.  How do I tell Openscad about that?

That?s odd?
Could you verify that you have the latest development snapshot of OpenSCAD and the latest master of both scad-utils and list-comprehension-demos?

If it still doesn?t work, you?re experiencing a system-dependent issue which would be high priority to fix.

There are some in scad-utils:

Your code renders as the attached image using F5. Could you make sure the code you attach the code that actually render what you see?

Some tips:
o I noticed that some of your faces are inside-out (e.g. ofaces at the top). You can visualize inside-out faces: They turn pink in Throwntogether mode (F12).
o You might want to use the latest development snapshot as a lot of bugs has been fixed and new feature are available.

Once you?re tried that, please send an updated file and screenshot and I can take a look at it.

 Cheer,
