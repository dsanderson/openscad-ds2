After some false starts, I found a method that is similar in spirit to what
Neon22 had mentioned which also ties in to the angle bisectors.  For my
purposes, because I intend to apply offsets to polygons that are not derived
from functions, I'm constraining myself and not assuming a differentiable
function.

Each vertex, as it is offset, moves along the angle bisector between the
adjacent edges.  Each edge then shrinks or expands and there exists an
offset (positive or negative) at which the edge vanishes to a point.  Beyond
that offset, the edge would be flipped, and needs to be removed with the two
adjacent edges connected to each other.

This can be accomplished by calculating for each edge an 'offset limit'
which is the offset (positive or negative) at which the edge will vanish. 
For edges where adjacent edges are parallel (and angle bisectors are
parallel) the offset limit is nan, which is okay as long as we handle it
properly.

Then for a given offset value, we can remove those edges that would be
flipped.  To fill in the gaps this program transforms edges into linear
equations and then reconstructs the vertices by solving the intersections.

One application of this operation might not be complete because removing an
edge will change the angle bisectors and potential offset limit for segments
that are adjacent to the removed segments, meaning that some edges may be
deemed "okay" (within offset limit) but after removing the flipped edges,
the previously okay edges can produce self-intersections.

For this reason the removal of edges is applied repeatedly until the number
of edges stops decreasing.

Technically I think it would be more correct to incrementally remove the
edges in order of increasing offset limit, because the opposite could
happen: an edge could be removed even though removing an adjacent edge would
change the angles and prevent flipping.  But for most cases I think this is
not needed.

Below is the code (also requires code from previous post) and the results. 
Also I should emphasize, if it's not already clear, this does not clean up
self intersections in general, it only cleans up self intersections that
result from high 'curvature' which causes edges to flip.  An hourglass shape
for example will self-intersect when offset and this approach will do
nothing to fix it.

After discussion regarding project plan. I have given allot of thought
to it and made following flow chart given in the doc.


https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aApCk8EhMfRhIVowKLpZG1hpHHiQJxtYKwW_K5h4H4A/edit?usp=sharing

I have thought of making back end for parameterization completely
separate from the parser (or code) for the original openscad language
(i.e separate parser for the parameterization ) unlike as in
meta-model branch. By making separate parser, we can have more than
one backend parser for parsing the parameter (basically as plug-in).
The parser could populate the parameter data structure with all the
necessary details and we can use that to GUI.


To start with data structure to store the information regarding the
parameters, I would like to know is their anything like scope of
variable in openscad language and If yes then what are the different
scope that a variable can be under.

Don't see exactly what you want to do. But let me remark some points. 

It is always better to start with some small N, like N=10. This saves time.

gen_dat() uses a 2D shape function like circle_() or airfoil_data() to
generate a series of parametrized polygons and a trajectory function to
place those shapes in 3D. sweep() knits this series together into a 3D
shape. It should be clear that this does has some constraints on the data. 

The data must be 'nice' enough to describe a non-self-intersecting 3D shape.
This means: 
1. each polygon must behave well to be 'knitable'
   - no self intersection !!
   - convex shape at best (like circle) or at minimum some half-symmetry
(like airfoil), because I used a lazy triangulation for the two cap faces (I
will update this one day - promised). You can try skin() instead of sweep()
if that is not the case. 
   - a common number of vertices. You can try skin() instead of sweep() if
that is not the case.
   - the right sense: CCW

2. The trajectory function must be 'nice'. 
 - 2D shapes are not allowed to intersect in 3D when being swept. If this is
unavoidable, split the data and union two (or more) sweeps.

3. My code does not test those things (OpenSCAD currently has no error
scheme for reporting problems), but it should be clear from general sweep()
semantics. 

Using thrown together view (f12) will reveal problems. Magenta shaped
triangles have wrong sense.

Hey,

Thanks for the diagram - it makes it more clear what you?re thinking.
I think it?s a bit of a mistake to separate the parameter parsing from the main parser. Mostly because this may be a lot of work which would later have to be redone as they would share a lot of logic.

I quickly drew a diagram showing my understanding of what we talked about (see attachment).
Note that I would suggest starting with the parameter description C++ data structure and UI renderer. This means that you can discover challenges and opportunities related to the UI end of things before committing to a particular syntax for parsing.
This are just suggestions for input.

There are multiple different scopes for variables (global scope, local scope, module scope, file scope). It should be the responsibility of the parser to extract the info about scopes, making the parameter extraction a simple AST traversal operation.

are you sure your 2D-shape is not self-intersecting? Try this: 

polygon(circle_(1, 20));

@Jamie K. Your approach is nice for convex polygons but it seems to fail at
sharp concave vertices.

Use this code instead: 

function circle_(L=1, N) = [
  for(j=[1,-1], i=[-1:1/N:1])  [j*L*i, j*L/Fatness*cos(i*90)]
];

and look at your radius. You use 800, this has no effect. Try this: 

module Blades(){
  intersection(){
     for(i=[0,120,240])
       rotate([0,i,0]) sweep(C);
  rotate([90,0,0]) cylinder(center=true, r=40, h=400);
  }
}

I thought of making separate parser for parsing parameters because nodes
related to parameters would not be of any use in AST of FileModule. and we
can keep the two separate
as FileModule is futher evaluted for making the geometric model and
parameter related nodes will be used in making input widgets. As, there
functionality differ so, I thought it would be better to keep both logic
and data for both ( parameter related data and data related to construction
of geometric model ) seperate.

Yes, It would increase compilation time of scad program a little and some
work have to be redone but I would decrease time for extracting parameters
as AST constructed for parameter will be small one.

This was all in mind for thinking to make separate parser for parameter

Yes, it's good and would be helpful for setting milestones and making
design plan

Not exactly. The negative offset curves should be rounded at concave
vertices and positive offset curves should be rounded at convex vertices.
So, even for convex polygons the method is incorrect with positive offsets
although it may be valuable as an approximation to some applications.

Message-ID: <1462195826348-17277.post@n5.nabble.com>

There is no 'natural' semantics for it. This one is a first and well done
step to implement stuff like that. Look at  offset
<https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Transformations#offset> 
. 
It always depends what you want to do. I guess it is not very difficult to
add an extra cycle cutting down or even rounding spiky corners. In this case
you have to deal with granularity. Another theme would be: how to do an
offset keeping the vertex count unchanged. And for an organic sweep using an
interpolation scheme the code has to be fast. The more general an algorithm
gets, the slower it is. 

But isn't it too much code (and time) already spent for the problem of the
theme starter? Especially as he is not willing to post any code himself. The
next questions will be: But how can I control wall thickness locally? And:
How to inset a 3D shape (of course with local control)? 

Again: OpenSCAD is not a language to implement sophisticated algorithms
doing look-ahead and look-aside and all that stuff. The one and only
important feature request would be an API allowing for function callout. 

In my eyes it doesn't make much sense to print a hollow airfoil with spars
and ribs anyway. Z-layers tend to break apart and that is the best way to
FDM print it. And why use ribs and spars then if you can use infill?

OK, ldLet?s keep that discussion open.
This is also a good indicator that the parser work belongs to the 3rd milestone, when we will know a lot more about what we?re building.

We need a way of making the values from the customizer available for rendering. I?m not sure how teepee solved that in his prototype branch, but this could be part of the evaluator (the component which transforms the AST to a CSG Tree).
Alternatively, we could modify the AST directly, by injecting the values back into the AST. I?m not sure what the best solution would be. It might be beneficial to app design to keep the AST read-only for subsequent processes, and thus merge customizer values during evaluation, but it?s a bit early to say.

FYI: MakerBot Customizer, simply re-runs the entire application with the values appended to the end of the .scad code. That could be an extreme quick&dirty solution which I wouldn?t recommend.

I think teepee used the alternative method thats why I asked regarding it.
As I way also thinking in that way. so, I didn't found any need to make
changes regarding evaluator.

So, we have two choices here also :) .

It's injecting the values into the top level assignments.

https://github.com/openscad/openscad/blob/model-meta-data3/src/mainwin.cc#L1723
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/blob/model-meta-data3/src/ParameterWidget.cc#L97

This works, but also interferes with the value coming from the
script. Referencing things to make the value available for evaluation
in addition to the value coming from the parser might be useful.

We do have the build server for Windows provided by Don, but it's not
automated currently.

There's not a huge amount of changes since the last build though.

Hey, the problem I mentioned in my proposal ( point number 5 in description
section ) related to current code in model-meta-data3 branch.
Is it due to this only?

I guess that's related, yes. We certainly don't want to always
override the GUI widgets with the values from the source code as
that would cause all controls to reset on every F5. Maybe some
kind of "reset to default"?

> And I am unable to understand what you are suggesting in second
> line related to "Referencing things ....."

The existing code iterates over all the assignments and just
forces the GUI values into that node in the AST tree. One other
option would be to hold the reference to the node from the
GUI widget so the value could be pushed to the node directly
if needed (instead of the search loop by variable name).
But that's already very deep in the implementation details :-)
We probably want to get the overall picture clear first.

ciao,
  Torsten.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Twisting imported 3D object
Message-ID: <1462351568100-17287.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hello everyone,
I would like to twist an 3D object after importing it. 
I am a new user. I have googled what I want to do and read the forum but
could not find any help on this. I might not know the correct keywords...
I have tried so far a script containing the following:
module myModule()
{
   linear_extrude(height=10, twist=360)   
   import("myfile.stl");
}

It did not work...
Any help would be welcome.
Thanks a lot,
Cheers,
Mike

You can only twist 2D objects. Try importing a DXF file.
Alternatively, you can squash your 3D object:  linear_extrude(height=10, twist=360) projection() import("myfile.stl");

This is the openSCAD forum, not KiCad.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Cylindrical Extrude
Message-ID: <1462554764057-17291.post@n5.nabble.com>

I wrote a cylindrical extrude module a while ago and thought that it might be
useful to others.  I have placed the scad files in the OpenSCAD folder on my
Microsoft OneDrive cloud server:

https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=625391B4CF1D545D!115&authkey=!AHZ3rqfLOct19dU&ithint=folder%2c

If you are interested start by watching the demonstration video
(CylindricalExtrudeDemo.mp4) to get an idea of what it does, then try the
examples in CylindricalExtrude_examples.scad .

Cheers,
Trygon

Subject: [OpenSCAD] error in rendering when using decimal point in variable
Message-ID: <1462640425199-17293.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi

The following draws three rounded boxes. The one where there is a decimal
point in circle radius, does not render correctly. This seems like a bug to
me.  Do I post bugs somewhere else?

module mod_roundedbox(box_x,box_y,box_z,rounding_r)
{
    union ()
        { 
        cube ([box_x - rounding_r*2, box_y,box_z],center=true); //narrower
in x direction
        cube ([box_x,box_y - rounding_r*2,box_z],center=true); //narrower in
y direction
        
        for (x = [rounding_r-box_x/2:-rounding_r+box_x/2])
            for (y = [rounding_r-box_y/2:-rounding_r+box_y/2])
                translate ([x,y,0]) cylinder (r=rounding_r, h=box_z,
center=true);; 
        };            
};

mod_roundedbox (154,72,c_wall_z,8); // renders correctly 
translate ([0,80,0]) mod_roundedbox (154,72,c_wall_z,8.1); //renders
incorrectly, the circle no longer lines up on several places, only
difference is that the radius is 8.1 here, not 8. Not all renderings with
value behind decimal point fail.

Is this a bug or by design?  How can I get this fixed?

OpenSCAD version 2015.03-3  on Mac OS X 10.10.5

This works:

module mod_roundedbox(box_x,box_y,box_z,rounding_r)
{
    union ()
        {
        cube ([box_x - rounding_r*2, box_y,box_z],center=true);
//narrowerin x direction
        cube ([box_x,box_y - rounding_r*2,box_z],center=true); //narrower
iny direction

        for (x = [rounding_r-box_x/2, -rounding_r+box_x/2])
            for (y = [rounding_r-box_y/2, -rounding_r+box_y/2])
                translate ([x,y,0]) cylinder (r=rounding_r,
h=box_z,center=true);
        }
}
c_wall_z = 20;

mod_roundedbox (154,72,c_wall_z,8.1);

With colons in the for statements you are generating lots of circles, not
just the corners. I.e. all the points between the two ends with a step size
of 1. When the size is not an integer the last circles are not in the
correct place.

I would never do it intentionally but it may happen in bugged user codes.
 I would expect undef but the line

crashes OpenSCAD.

Why is this bugged code? It doesn't crash my version (Windows 64, 2016.04.06)

You use the 'show-only' operator. It will ignore all of the design beside its
operand. So translate() will not execute. If you wanna see the translation,
try 


> ! translate([0,0,(B+P+O)+(D/2)])
>                 cube([C, H+2, D], center = true); 

instead of 

>  translate([0,0,(B+P+O)+(D/2)])
>                 !cube([C, H+2, D], center = true);

If you got errors:
DEPRECATED: Imported file (Turntable_V01.stl) found in document root instead
of relative to the importing module. This behavior is deprecated 

Tried to find by google and forums how to do insted?
Resides in same library as my scad file
import("Turntable_V01.stl");

Still works watching ( F5) and rendering (F6 ) aslong as you ONLY have the
importline you can also export an stl.

But my goal were to modify the turntable ( F5 ) looks good ( F6 ) only
rendering my add ons???

I am lost, plz guide me right.

I'm trying to figure this out by reading the source code.

The DEPRECATED message is just a warning, not a fatal error. It should only
be issued if the import() statement occurs inside a *.scad file that is
include-d or use-d by another *.scad file, as discussed here:
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/217

This means you haven't shown all of your source code; there should be two
*.scad files involved. The first is a "parent" scad file, which uses or
includes a "child" scad file, which contains an import statement.

The *.stl file should be in the same directory as the "child" scad file,
and not in the same directory as the "parent" scad file. If you do this,
the DEPRECATED message should go away.

One step further.
Made an add.scad file with just a line ( below ).
Then instead of importing I included the file.
Results are the same the things I add will be viewed when I do F6 but looks
nice all toghether in preview (F5).
But no errors or warnings
The stl file can be found here:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:37222/#files
Then It may solve something?

This sounds a bit like this issue from the FAQ:

Yup!
There it was.
A crappy STL-file ( they should not publish those... )
So sorry to bother you all but I have learned a lot.
I think I do my own from the beginning in openscad.
A shortcut is not always a shortcut.
Thanks again all.

Keep reporting those btw., and link to the files if you can.
Our longer-term goal is to be more robust at importing problematic files, e.g. through auto-repair, so the more examples we have, the better we can test this in the future.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Compile F5 image does not match Render F6
Message-ID: <1463382769604-17318.post@n5.nabble.com>

I have an OpenSCAD model that uses some STL imports and the difference
command to create some threads.  The model looks fine when compiled in F5
but when I Render using F6 the treaded holes created with the difference
command disappear.I was able to get them originally, but when I added more
elements to the model the will not show up in the F6 Render, almost like
there is not enough memory.There are no errors that come up in the dialog
box and Flushing Caches does not solve the problem.Running Mac OS 10.6.8,
6GB RAM, OpenSCAD version 2013.01

I've had the same thing happen as you show in the images. It's likely the
easy fix is to increase the length of the "differenced" part that creates
the threaded holes by 0.01 in the direction that is showing the half hole in
the image. Sometimes the peculiar behavior is the other way around, in F5 it
appears closed, while F6 will present an open (desired) hole.

There is a strong likelihood that the STL is invalid.
Check it with Netfabb or share it here and I can check it.

In the image provided, it would likely present a failure, but I'd expect that
once the difference cylinders or shapes are corrected, the whole package
would verify.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] getting craxy from f5 f6 issues
Message-ID: <1463423262947-17323.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hello there

I am still working on the design of 3D mouthpieces for sax and bass
clarinet.
The programme is improving, but I spend 80% of the time on F5 F6 issues.
I mean the issues that cause f5 to succeed and f6 to fail.
By the way: I generate all my objects inside one scad file (off almost 1000
lines) and no imports of stl are used.

The main route I follow to solve it is
1) find the error
2) find the cause
3) fix the cause

Finding the error is not easy. These are the ways I tried:
- use F12 (thrown together) to check if no part is inside out
- use mesh_lab to check for boundary errors, non-manifold edges, non
manifold vertices
- use net_fabb basic to detect other errors

Finding the cause is easy depending the length and structure of your
programme and the quality of your memory (mine is not very good) to remember
why you made it that way?

The first question is if there is another way to find errors?

Seconc question:
An illustration of one of the problems I encounter.

This is my main programme:
/module mouthpiece () 
{
    //translate([-5,0,z_window_round-2]) cube([100,100,0.1]);
    difference()
    {
        union()
        {
            // generate the basic round shape of the outside
            // including the flat table side
           outside_base($fn);   echo("Generated Outside");
        }
        // subtract all other parts

        chamber($fn);                echo("Generated Chamber");
        //bore($fn);                    echo("Generated Bore");
        //tip($fn);                   echo("Generated Tip");
        //beak(3*$fn);                  echo("Generated Beak");
        //roundwindow($fn);           echo("Generated Roundwindow");

        //serialnumber(17);           echo("Generated Serial");
        //type(Type);                 echo("Generated Type");
        //logo($fn);                  echo("Generated Logo");
    }
    
}/

I disabled a lot of objects now. The chamber gives problems.
When I increase $fn above 68 f6 does not work anymore.
When I generate chamber separately and check the stl of it with meshlab of
nettfab it is OK.
mouthpiece_v23part0.rar
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n17324/mouthpiece_v23part0.rar>  
The file of this part is enclosed.
So I do not know a way anymore to find the bug. 

Who can help me?

Looks like you do some nonlinear extrusion for the core shape -  and thus it
smells like home-made meshing problems. If you are using my interpolation
scheme try to lower N or use a different extrusion trajectory to avoid self
intersection.

Since these are most likely bugs in OpenSCAD, it would be helpful to have access to the failing .scad files.
As usual, the smaller the files are, the easier it is for us to collect them, analyze them and add automated tests for them.

Hello Parkinbot,

What do you mean with non lineair extrusion and how do you come to that
conclusion. I mean, what tool do you use to detect that.

This is a part of the code. I am afraid it's a little too complex.

-----------------------------------
module chamber(fn=80)

    xbore = r_bore(z_bore_round);
    z_rooftop = fz_rooftop();
    x_rooftop = fx_rooftop(xbore);
   
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // prepare curved ramp
    delta_z_ramp = z_window_round-z_ramp;
    delta_x_ramp = 0.1+x_table(z_window_round)-r_bore(z_ramp);
    radius_ramp   = delta_z_ramp/sin(ramp_curve);
    xref_ramp    = r_bore(z_ramp) + radius_ramp;
    x_factor     =  radius_ramp * (1-cos(ramp_curve))/delta_x_ramp;

    x_bottom = [for  (n = [0:1:i_ch_w_tip])
        (n_to_z(n)<z_ramp)?     r_bore(n_to_z(n)):      // bottom of bore
top not rounded
                                                        // stepped ramp

You are right. This is how the corners look enlarged in nett_fab.
But the problem is how to detect that without your kind help ;-).

@parkinbot.

Can you explain a little more about the causes you suspect, or give some
references?
Maybe unknowingly I violate some design rules.
By the way what do you mean with self intersection?

Message-ID: <1463444406887-17331.post@n5.nabble.com>

How did I suspect? 
F5 is done in GPU, F6 uses CGAL. F6 typically fails if some self
intersection (SI) occurs or mesh problems are detected. F5 is more tolerant
with both. 
Also I know that the scheme I've coded works as long self intersection (SI)
is avoided. So:

1. your shape generator function must create *simple* polygons for any
parametrisation used during the sweep. Indeed, if you use my sweep() instead
of skin()) it has to be quasi-symmetric like an airfoil because I used a
lazy triangulation scheme - another caveat and say, another 'bug' I'll have
to address one day.

2. the trajectory used must avoid SI during extrusion. This needs some more
explanation. Let's define a trajectory as the polygon along which the origin
[0,0] will 'move' during a sweep. Then you can find many different (indeed
in theory: infinitely many) trajectories for extruding the 'same' shape.
Some of them might lead to self intersection, others not. Trajectories are
only granted to be non-SI when they are linear. With non-linear ones you
better take very good care, what you are doing. 

So, what is the trick? Imagine you want to sweep a ring. Usually you would
tend to sweep along the skeleton line which is the circle with radius
(R+r)/2. But that is not wise for narrow curvatures because it favors SI for
small (!) N. If you use the small radius as trajectory and sweep along the
inner circle no SI can happen.
If SI during a sweep is unavoidable at some point, you can always use
piecewise sweeps and a union(). Your shape looks like you're doing this
already. 

BTW. Meanwhile I'm stumbling more and more over people in Thingiverse who
publish fancy things having copied large parts of my library code into their
own code without giving reference or attribution. Some projects even look
like they have a commercial dimension. So, please let me remind you, that I
am publishing my libraries for non-commercial use only. Other purpose has to
be licensed.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Slice object into overlapping slices for laser cutter
 (like 123D Make but better)
Message-ID: <1463489139419-17332.post@n5.nabble.com>

123D Make can slice objects and these slices can be cut on a laser cutter and
glued together to form an object. Great, only the slices don't overlap so
the resulting object is not so strong, especially if you are using slices
that lock together to form an object bigger than you can cut in your cutter. 

Here's what I need:
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n17332/block_work.png> 

Would it be possible, appropriate to commission someone here to make a
function to take an object and slices it according to how thick the material
is we are cutting, and according the the size limit of the laser cutter?
This would be really useful to be able to do. What would be a fair price for
this programming? Perhaps I could release it to everyone as I'd imagine it
would be useful for a lot of people? Or maybe it's already out there and I
just need to know the right words to search for?

Just to be clear again, here's the program that does it imperfectly:
www.123dapp.com/make

and some screenshots:
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n17332/google_images.png> 

As I say, I just want to be able to make something with OVERLAPPING slices
that can form an object bigger than the laser cutter bed strongly. I don't
even mind a bit of excess material as I can trim that off manually

Message-ID: <1463507549048-17334.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hello Parkinbot,

I will try to describe what I understand.

1) 
Self intersection is that the situation that the cross section of an object
is not s simple polygon like a circle but one like an 8 wich has an
intersection? So can that be caused when my object has a very sharp tip that
does not end in one point but has some kind of overshoot?

The objects I make have a shape like this:
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n17334/shape1.jpg> .
They are symmetric in one of the horizontal directions. Is that good enough
for the sweep function?

2)
I suppose the trajectory of the extrusion is line through the centers of the
sweeped polygons. I my case this is the z-axis. So there is no risk for SI?

And is this (left is OK, right is wrong) what you mean with the ring
example: 
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n17334/shape2.png> 

Another thing is that I like to sweep from a pylogon with 16 points to 14 to
12 etc.
I suppose that is not possible so what I do is increase the number of
coinciding points from 0 to 2 4 etc.
Is that the right way?

Is there a tool that can detect problematic SI?

I can understand that you like to be referred or whatever. I will try to
respect that. I do not intend to go commercial with the mouthpieces, but
you'll never know. Do you have any idea how you want to be referred. Of
course tha same applies with the  development team of Openscad of course.

Thanks to the discussion about intersection I added some checks and that
cause the top corners of the object to look much better. Thanks!!

Hello Johan 

I have discussed the self intersecting stuff before  here
<http://forum.openscad.org/Splines-for-drawing-fan-blades-tp16784p17265.html>  
and you might be also interested in  this thread
<http://forum.openscad.org/Polygon-Offset-Function-tp17186.html>  , where I
also answer the number of points per polygon in a sweep question - if is not
feasable to you to use a common N, skin() will be your friend. Further have
a look into the simple polygon discussion. 

Concering the trajectory, best always look at linear_extrude(). 


> linear_extrude(height = 100, twist = 0)
>   square (10, center = true);

and 


> linear_extrude(height = 100, twist = 360)
>   square (10, center = true);

and 


> linear_extrude(height = 100, twist = 360)
>   square (10, center = false);

same shape, even same trajectories (the first two, the third one has
internally a translation), but different results. 

No self intersection can happen on a linear_extrude, that's why it is in
language. But imagine the trajectory would be an 8, which can easily be done
with a sweep. Even if F6 will output it (falsely), boolean operations will
fail.

About the licensing: The rules are easy to respect. 
If you wanna go commercial contact me and get a license for what you intend
to do. 
If you publish your code using my library, refer to its origin. 
Refrain from copying my library code partly into your own scad files, if not
forced by a bug in my code. 
Use the same (or an even stronger) licensing model for your code, if it uses
mine.

No, you want to have every slice cut into smaler pieces.
How do you want them labeled to put them together in the right order?
And you need alignment tabs?

There are already soltions for a similar problem on thingiverse: Cut stl's
into smaller pieces to print them on smaller print beds of 3d-printers.
Does someone remember this? I cant find it t the moment.

if you define static variables at the outer scope of the main file, you can
use them within modules defined in the main file without passing them as
arguments. This is also true for modules defined within included files.

It is not true for modules defined within run files.

Jago, 

slicing a 3D object into any pattern of pieces with free (or fixed) sizing
is a task OpenScad is equipped for. What about the data format and object
size you deliver and which formats can your laser cutter consume? OpenScad
can read STL and write DXF and SVG for this purpose. 
If that is what you are seeking, a batch file with parametrized OpenScad
commandline calls generating a series of pieces with naming scheme would be
the preferable solution. So, what is your platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS)?

Rudolf

Also you can render OpenSCAD to STL and slice with Slic3r, which is
free/open source.

http://slic3r.org/

It can render to G-code or SVG.

"The Bullet Physics Playground" is a Qt5 app, that allows you to simulate
physics objects in an OpenGL GUI with Lua scripting.

You can create OpenSCAD STL meshes on the fly, see this "Hello World!" demo

  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbElbcZ6Sa0

You can create gears, motors and hinges

Almost there. The tiles of one slice should be offset relative to the
adjacent ones.

The parameters dx and dy (between 0 and 1) of tile() allow for small tilling
displacement to avoid too small tilling pieces in a layer by layer basis.

Yes almost, 

I'd say, the task is to slice a 3D-object first into slices as Peter
startet. As those slices are laser cut, each one has to be cut into the
cells size of an ordinary grid, with each piece fitting into the cutter's
bed. 
Adjacent slices will be glued together. So, second, the grid of every second
slice needs an xy-offset of half of the bed size, as shown in the initial
drawing. 

The problem is not the slicing. It is the output of, say, some hundreds of
DXF, one for each piece.
and of course finding a good global grid offset. 

So the scad programm itself will be more or less a function taking some
parameters (bed size, material thickness, piece number) and will be called
by some (outer) script/program enumerating the pieces. 

Indeed, I'd implement the full cutting logic with some programming language
that offers more interactiveness (and can also query the STL for a bounding
box), and call out to a 'dumb' .SCAD, more or less a three liner, that loads
the STL, intersects it with a cube(bed_x, bed_y, material_z) translated to
the mask position and project that down for DXF export.

Well done everyone :-) Thank you Peter and others for writing this code. 

Yes this is true Rudolf, that labelling the parts for them to glue together
is another aspect, as is getting all the output into the right lasercutter
bed size in DXF. To this end this Slic3r is a really good head start but I
can't see it can make lager parts from smaller ones. The OpenSCAD code is
also great though and I can see many people using and finding this useful.
It might be better to have this function in Slic3r. hmm

 I'm just a starter.
I scanned my wife and obtained a bust.? The resulting STL after repairing has a hole viewed from?the bottom.? Thick of it as a inverted bucket.?I would like to close the bottom to facilitate printingg.? Please suggest how I can accomplish this in OpenSCAD?

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Errors when operating on an STL file
Message-ID: <1463668372097-17372.post@n5.nabble.com>

I am trying to halve an object imported from an STL file.  However, it looks
funny when previewed.  And an error appears in console after rendering.

Rendering Polygon Mesh using CGAL...
ERROR: CGAL error in CGAL_Nef_polyhedron3(): CGAL ERROR: assertion
violation! File:

Line: 377 Explanation: it is not possible to decide which one is a visible
facet (if any)

May I know the reason why?   And how can this problem be solved.

Thanks.

I searched the forum again and seemed to find something similar.  Following
the suggestion to install netfabb and fiddle around, a self-intersection is
shown as below:

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n17373/20160520_23.jpg> 


However, the Basic version doesn't allow me to do anything to repair it
unless upgrading to the professional version.  I tried opening it in
3D-builder and it didn't reveal any problem and thus nothing to repair.  Is
there any other way to deal with this self intersection problem?   And is it
this problem that is causing trouble when applying boolean operation on this
STL file in OpenSCAD?

Thanks.

Try :

z=0;
a=10;

import("myfile1.stl", convexity=5);
translate([x,y,z])cube(a);

Move the cube around to fill the hole. Then export as stl.

I don't think you can do any CSG operations on a non-manifold STL in
OpenScad.

If you aren't going to restrict yourself to OpenSCAD, the free program
Meshmixer will allow you to "drop" a plane surface anywhere in the
workspace, then angle and slice it in the desired manner, closing off the
opening of the upside down bucket. Even if you are not especially
comfortable with a new program, there are more than a few video tutorials
presenting the above actions, bringing rapid understanding with a few
clicks.

Yes, boolean uses CGAL which needs intact geometry.

And indeed.  After fixing it using the free microsoft online repair service,
I can render it perfectly.
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n17382/20160521_110705_WILLIAM-LENOVO_William.jpg> 

However, there are still some missing faces under Preview as before (but
that's of little concern to me)
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n17382/20160521_11.jpg> 

The online tutorial looks helpful; I will study it carefully.  After
googling with "netfabb basic stl repair", I found the netfabb cloud service. 
Is it the same as the one offered by microsoft?  ... as it says it "extends
the functionality of the free netfabb Studio Basic by some enhanced repair
capabilities otherwise only available in netfabb Studio Professional."

Thanks once again.

The missing faces in preview are probable due to a missing convexity
parameter in the import statement.

Message-ID: <1463816675181-17384.post@n5.nabble.com>

I use openscad since a few month and I did not buy a laptop that was prepared
for that.
The CPU has to work quite hard for the rendering proces.
I often get the warning that I have heating problems and that I have to turn
off the laptop immediately.

Problem is that the rendering sometimes takes quite long and cannot be
paused, I think. Or is there a trick to do that?

Also the viewing after F5 takes a lot of CPU capacity. 
Is it possible to stop the viewing process?

You should consider that a typical computer is designed to remove heat in
such a manner as to never have the type of message you are seeing unless
there is something wrong.

If this is an older laptop, you could have too much dust on the cooling fins
within the laptop. With the power turned off, use an air stream from a can
of air or air compressor and apply it to the vents on the underside and/or
back of your laptop. Use very short bursts of air, as you do not want to
force the internal fan to spin at high speed, which would happen with long
bursts of air. If you perform this task in a well-lighted area, you will see
dust from the exit vents.

If this does not cause your machine to run cooler, it is possible that the
heat sink thermal paste has dried out, especially if this is an older
laptop. That is more complicated to fix, as it is necessary to disassemble
entirely the laptop. The thermal transfer assembly must be removed from the
processor, all surfaces cleaned and thermal transfer paste re-applied, then
re-assembled.

Perhaps you will get lucky and find it needs only to have the dust removed.

I was always taught that vacuum (sucking) was better than blowing, 
because the latter can force things to get jammed into place, while 
vacuum pulls things out.  I may be wrong.

If you can identify where the warm air is exiting from your laptop, 
another possibility is to position a fairly strong muffin fan right next 
to the laptop, so that it pulls more air through the cooling system.  
Not elegant or convenient, but it might get you through this particular 
incident.

For the cooling system in a laptop, the airflow is limited to the fans and
fins and it's more difficult to vacuum dust than it is to direct an air
stream to dislodge the particles. For the fun of it, on a throw-away laptop,
I used high pressure air for a long period of time and destroyed the fan. It
sounded like a turbine engine until it didn't. I probably overheated any
bearings or contact surfaces, but it was a throw-away, so no real harm done. 

In a desktop computer, the air from a compressor hose or can is dispersed
more widely, but still dislodges the dust. Using a vacuum has a higher
chance to suck or break a component.

Occasionally, I've had to re-seat memory chips after blowing dust from a
desktop computer.

Another note, if the problem is dust or dried thermal transfer paste, an
additional external fan will not resolve the overheating. There is
insufficient heat transfer with the current air flow, but it's not likely
related to insufficient airflow.

I know OpenSCAD has some problems when small scales come into play.
Nevertheless, this result astounds me. Looks like polygon() tries to simply
its points using some Voronoi magic.

Yes, it's completely bonkers. As step reduces you get more facets until about
2 then they reduce again. circ(0.001) is a square!

Thanks for the tip.  Me lazy guy finally got to read the manual.  And in the
import() section, convexity was explained clearly.  I set it to 10 and the
preview is now flawless.  

More questions.  What is the default value for convexity?  And why do I need
to tell OpenCSG what it is?  (I know it may get a little technical)

And in that same section, my original question was also answered.  

++++++++++++++
If you want to render the imported STL file later, you have to make sure
that the STL file is "clean". This means that the mesh has to be manifold
and should not contain holes nor self-intersections. If the STL is not
clean, you might get errors like:
...
or
...
(... looks like the CGAL error message I was getting)

In order to clean the STL file, you have the following options:
- use http://wiki.netfabb.com/Semi-Automatic_Repair_Options . This will
repair the holes but not the self-intersections.
- use netfabb basic. This free software doesnt have the option to close
holes nor can it fix the self-intersections
- use MeshLab, This free software can fix all the issues
++++++++++++++++

It mentions MeshLab but not the free online netfabb service.   Worth taking
a look into MeshLab?

Thanks.

I must say sorry about this.  It was my first question and I was confused
about the various subscription/registration processes.  It was thus sent as
an email to discuss at lists.openscad.org.  I realized I was stupid and now I
am using the forum.openscad.org user interface to compose the messages.

Here is a picture of the scan.

(She's not my wife but a student I tutored at a charity organisation.  And I
am glad that the kids, though underprivileged, are still as awestruck as I
was when they saw their first printings.  They were mesmerized in front of
the printer for twenty or so minutes just to watch the print head dance!)

I hope you can see that there is a hole in the bottom of the bust.  I think
I may be able to print it out with the hole but if I can, I would like to
close it flat.

Thanks @nophead for the suggestion of adding a base.  I would see if I can
retain the bust base contour as is.

I will take a look at meshmixer.  It looks interesting.  But you must
understand this 3D printing thing is a really daunting task for a starting
guy like me.  Although my technical background (electronics) helps a bit, it
is still overwhelming with all the choices of software/hardware.

thanks all.

As a workaround you can scale your points up, then back down like this:

scale(1e-6) polygon(circ(1));
translate([2, 0]) scale(1e-6) polygon(circ(0.01));

function circ(step=1) = [for(i=[0:step:360])  [1e6*sin(i), 1e6*cos(i)]];

@thehans: stability around 1 should be granted, as many (vector based)
problems have normalized approaches. I tracked the effect down to a
simplistic example from a much more sophisticated context. But be honest:
You don't wanna use a workaround like yours in every second function of a
sophisticated context. 

I'd rather prefer this form, which I would expect polygon() could do itself

For F6 render, there is a small close icon (X in a circle) at the end of the
progress bar after the n/1000, however, it is only tested between CGAL
calls, if CGAL is in a lengthy operation it can take a long time.
Unfortunately one of the longest is the final union of all objects. So
cancelling can be a problem.

I tend to cancel the process. As OpenSCAD auto-saves you can get any edits
back if needed.

F5 will use a lot of cpu if you use render(), minkowski(), resize() and I
think offset() as these use CGAL. There is no cancel function for F5.

You say "viewing after F5", if that means F5 is finished, but viewing such
as moving the object, is slow, then you need a new PC, or break-up your
model as it is usually a very complex model causing this.

The explanation for this behaviour is clear. A 2d shape like polygon is 
tessellated using integer coordinates. There is no infinite precision, 
and in fact not even floating point precision. As you use smaller and 
smaller (floating point) steps, more and more neighbouring points end up 
having identical integer coordinates during tessellation.

There is a silent built-in assumption of model scale in 2d tessellation 
and thus an assumption of minimum point separation. In your case, this 
assumption of minimum point separation breaks down. You would still 
expect some kind of uniform distribution and not what you got, so there 
is probably more to the story, but that's another issue.

As mentioned elsewhere, a work around is to scale up the coordinates 
enough to get unique integer coordinates during tessellation, then scale 
down the resulting shape afterwards, for example:

f = 10;
scale(1/f)polygon(circ(1));
translate([2, 0]) scale(1/f) polygon(circ(1/f));

function circ(step=1) = [for(i=[0:step:360]) [f*sin(i), f*cos(i)]];

Hello everyone, thanks for reacting.

I was really considering to buy a new laptop. But min is only 2 years old.
So I did first some cleaning (dust removal from the ventilation opening).
It seems to help. The laptop sound less noisy when calculating.
I also be more patient. Not watching yuotube moving while waiting to render.
I saw that that the temperature is going up when I do that.

I had not noticed the subtile x in the right corner: thanks for that.
I will try the kill operation.

Torsten, thanx for the link. Seems to be another brillant example of a time
consuming but effectless discussion.

My opinion is, that if I call polygon() with a points argument containing N
points, I want to have a polygon with N points and not even one less. 

A reasonable grain control should at least enforce some minimum grid or
distance (max or even Euclidean norm) so that one would end up with some
maximum number of points in my example. The implemented "the more you put
in, the less you get out" scheme is a clear bug.

Not only a huge bug but also a regression. Polygon used to work before the
2D subsystem was re-written to not use CGAL. I preferred the slow version
that gave accurate results.

That sounds like the change was made to annoy people, I'm
pretty sure that was not the intention. While CGAL might be
accurate in most cases, it's also very much unstable at times,
which is not really a good thing for an application either.

Otherwise, I agree with Parkinbot: "Seems to be another brillant
example of a time consuming but effectless discussion."

It's raised and acknowledged as a bug, so talking circles
around it will only make this thread longer.

ciao,
  Torsten.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Curved linear extrude
Message-ID: <059101d1b53b$6bcc8b00$4365a100$@alexgibson.net>

Hi all,

 

I am modelling a top hat, and would be grateful for suggestions as to the
most efficient way to extrude the basic oval shape of the hat over an arc.

 

I am most of the way there with the basic shape with this:

 

linear_extrude(height = 153, center = true, convexity = 10, scale=1.19875)

scale([1,1.19255])

                                circle(161/2);

 

The change I need to make is that the scale factor of the linear_extrude
needs to increase from bottom to top, so it widens out over a curve - and
the top of the hat flares out a little.

 

I've done a lot of modelling in OpenSCAD but not played much with
mathematical functions, so any pointers would be appreciated.  I'd like to
take this further, to also twisting the top of the hat, based on what I
learn from this.

 

Many thanks,

Alex

Have a look at this code. It uses an exponential funktion.

in a more general formulation you would write your own function f to
describe the trajectory. E.g.

I would use another approach. For curved surfaces I generally prefer to build
the form from meshes of calculated points and compose everything with
polyhedron. Here is a possible code:

> n   = 22;       // oval points

> f   = 1.19255;  // oval factor

> // a profile to be taken as a scale factor: change the function to your
> taste
> a = 0.1;   b = 5;   c = 3;   m = 10;
> profiler = [ for(i=[0:m]) 1+a*pow((i/b),c) ];
> // a rectangular mesh of points around the form
> surface = [ for(i=[0:m]) [for(p=oval) profiler[i]*p+[0,0,h*i/m] ] ];
>

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n17411/hat.png> 
The form is based on an elliptic oval and a scale profile. A mesh is built
from them.
The show_closed_mesh module is a very simple version of a more general
version I coded. It takes only one envelope in the form of a (closed) mesh
and closes it with two planar faces. If needed this two faces may be
triangulated.

Yes - this is exactly it, thanks very much.  I will play about with it until
I can properly use all aspects.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Polygon using relative points rather than absolute?
Message-ID: <1464091730798-17414.post@n5.nabble.com>

I'm trying to draw a complex shape with the polygon tool, and find it would
be easier to build the correct shape if I could place each successive point
in the polygon referenced from the previous point, rather than the origin as
it normally is when using 'polygon'. This just makes resolving where each
point is easier, as it's just [+x,+y] from the previous point, rather than
having to add up all the previous points. However, as usual, how to actually
program this escapes me! For example, a simple shape would be:

points_absolute = [[0,0],[10,0],[15,10],[10,20],[0,20],[-5,10]];
polygon (points_absolute);

I'd like points to be:
points_relative = [[0,0],[10,0],[5,10],[-5,10],[-10,0],[-5,-10]];

so that each subsequent point is calculated by adding up the proceeding
points.

I think there are a number of ways of doing this. Probably the easiest is to
iterate through the array, stepping through each point, and adding up the
proceeding points in a loop, and creating a new array with them added
together. I'm sure this is actually quite trivial, but I just can't quite
seem to get it right! Can anyone help?

Yeah, summing up things with OpenSCAD is not real fun.

Here is a better version that should be O(n) and tail recursive, I think.
Perhaps easier to understand as well as it is more like a procedural loop.

points_relative = [[0,0],[10,0],[5,10],[-5,10],[-10,0],[-5,-10]];

function rel_to_abs(list, i = 0, sum = [0,0], result = []) =
    i == len(list) ? result : rel_to_abs(list, i + 1, sum + list[i],
concat(result, [sum + list[i]]));

points_absolute = rel_to_abs(points_relative);
echo(points_absolute);

polygon(points_absolute);

@nophead
The original problem is O(n^2). There are n*(n+1)/2 sums to be done, where n
is the size of the array of points. So there is no O(n) algorithm for it. 
Your first solution is better because it is clearer. To avoid recursion, you
may consider:

>     function sum_list(list, to=0) =
>     [ for(i=[0:len(list)-1]) (i<=to) ? 1 : 0 ] * list ;

which is very general and applies to list of numbers, vectors, matrices,
etc.
But that is a question of taste. :)

Sorry, my analysis is completely wrong. The problem is O(n).

That is an interesting way of summing a vector by using a dot product with
a vector of ones.

I think the tail recursive version will be the fastest because my
understanding is OpenScad will optimise it into a loop. It is equivalent to

i = 0;
sum = [0, 0];
result = [];
while(i < len(list))  {
    result = concat(result, sum + list[i]);
    sum = sum + list([i]);
    i = i + 1;
}

Yes you can use less parameters but it makes it less readable and less
efficient. Is there any advantage?

Using the c-style for() this can be expressed by:

pr = [[0,0],[10,0],[5,10],[-5,10],[-10,0],[-5,-10]];

points = [ for (idx = 0, p = pr[0];idx < len(pr);idx = idx + 1, p = p + pr[idx]) p ];
polygon(points);

Note that this is an experimental feature in the dev snapshots
and needs to be enabled in the preferences ("lc-for-c").

ciao,

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Linear extrude along dxf contour or alog array of points
	in 2d/3d
Message-ID: <1464119134500-17424.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hello,

I wanted to draw a curved bended round wire in OpenSCAD and could not find
an easy way for this.

First I was going to draw 2d curve in Inkscape, then export it to dxf, then
linear_extrude in OpenSCAD then make it smooth somehow.

So, finally, I was no able to solve the making it smooth part. Tried
minkowski in this way

/  minkowski() {
    linear_extrude(height=1) import(file="wire1-43d.dxf");
    sphere(r=0.5);
  }/

and it makes OpenSCAD hang for a long time even on F5 preview (if use
$fn=100 it would hang forever and can even kill the computer itself).

Then I found this link which looks like what I wanted (even 2d would be
enough for me)
http://forum.openscad.org/smooth-3-D-curves-td7766.html

but it appeared that the shape path of the curve is generated by some kind
of math algorithm and I could not get an easy way from its code to generate
same thing from array of points and I want to draw complex curve shape in
Inkscape anyway.

So for now I am thinking of drawing this wire in blender (or export cubic
stl from OpenSCAD and smooth it in blender). But I though how naturally this
could be done if OpenSCAD could make linear_extrude along 2d (or 3d)
contour.

This could be either:
- array or 2d points (polygon)
- imported dxf
- array of 3d points

This would allow to draw not only round wires, but wires on any complex
shape.

I suppose, technically this could be easily implemented inside engine: this
would require making a series of normal linear_extrudes for each segment by
the height of the segment and then rotating extruded shape to follow segment
direction.

Also, this same thing could be implemented manually in OpenSCAD language, if
import dxf could return contour points like an array of 2d points to
manipulate inside OpenSCAD program. Probably, it already has this option?

thank's

Wow, not surprising I was having trouble with this! I know there is a lot of
functionality in functions, but I really don't have the programming skills
to make this work, and barely understand the logic behind what you guys have
written anyway! However, I'll take a good look at it with the Openscad
manual in hand, and work out what you've done, as a way of educating myself
(slowly).

Thanks!

I think, what you want to do, is an general extrusion respectivly a sweep.
Programs like sketchup have build-in support for this, OpenSCAD has not.
There is no extrude() primitive, as general extrusion is not a well-defined
operation like linear_extrude or rotate_extrude().

The easiest (but also slow) way to do a sweep (for convex shapes) is using
hull() to connect short 'pieces' of the extruded shape placed along a given
tracjectory in 3D: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:648813

Another way would be to use the sweep-libary, which is not defined for
arbitrary 2D-shapes, but can be easily extended to draw own shapes. The
mechanism to define trajectories is a bit tedious.
http://forum.openscad.org/Twisty-problem-with-scad-utils-quot-sweep-quot-td9775.html

If 2D extrusion is enough for you, you might want to try offset(),

I have understood you are comparing here my proposal of sum_list without
recursion with your recursive sum_points.
First of all, your sum_points is not tail recursive and always returns
[0,0]. A tail recursive version of it might be:

> function sum_points2(list, i, sum=[0,0]) = 
>     i < 0 ? 
>         sum:

I could not compare the running time of both alternatives (tail recursion X
non recursion) because my sum_list is limited to lists of less than 1000000
points due to the for inside. Thats is an advantage of a tail-recursive
solution indeed.

I did compared the running time of my rel_to_abs2 with your rel_to_abs. They
both required approximately the same running time. However, what bugged me
was that the running time seems to be a lot more than O(n). May be O(n^2).

Anyway, ll those alternatives are toys compared with the Torsten's code! It
runs a lot faster and I could not find a limit of it.

Yes, I think for something like that a general sweep is required for 
that. As you say. things can easily become less well defined than 
linear_extrude, you need to control the orientation of the sweep profile 
along the sweep path, and that might be tricky using only some basic 
parameters.

Although not quite the same as general sweep, I have been playing with a 
related (unreleased/experimental) feature in my AngelScript application. 
It might provide some inspiration for OpenSCAD:

The general idea I had was to allow "extruding" from one general profile 
(bottom) to another (top), where both of the profiles may themselves be 
results of 2d boolean operations and possibly include holes. I'm not 
sure what a proper name for this feature is, but for lack of a better 
idea I call it "transform_extrude" for now. Here is a complete working 
example:

// AngelScript CSG.
const double pi = 4.0*atan(1.0);
double to_rad(double deg) { return pi*deg/180.0; } // to radians from 
degrees

shape@ main_shape()
{
   double ro = 12.5;
   double ri = 0.9*ro;
   shape2d@ bot_hole = scale(sx:1,sy:0.8)*circle(r:ri);
   shape2d@ top_hole = rotate_z(to_rad(deg:15))
                      *offset2d(sh:square(ri*sqrt(2),center:true),r:3);

   shape2d@ bot = difference2d(square(2*ro,center:true),bot_hole) ;
   shape2d@ top = difference2d(circle(ro*sqrt(2)),top_hole);
   return transform_extrude(bottom:bot,top:translate(0,0,2*ro)*top);
}

void main()
{
    shape@ obj = main_shape();
    obj.write_xcsg(GetOutputFullPath('.xcsg'),secant_tolerance:0.001);
}

As you see, the bottom profile is a square with an elliptic hole, and 
the top profile is a circle with a z-rotated square hole with filleted 
corners. The final body is "transform_extrude"d from the bottom to the 
translated top profile. It is possible to rotate either of the profiles 
so they are no longer parallel planes in 3d, but it isn't done here. See 
attached image of the result displayed with OpenSCAD.

Perhaps you want to consider similar things in OpenSCAD. It is perhaps 
conceivable to extend this line of thought towards general sweep.

Ian, to understand the codes people have posted in the thread I would
suggest that you study the following topics and their examples:
a)  OpenSCAD User Manual/For C/Java/Python Programmers
<https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/For_C/Java/Python_Programmers>  
b)  user defined functions
<https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/User-Defined_Functions_and_Modules> 
,
c)  list comprehension
<https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/List_Comprehensions>  

List comprehension is very powerful specially combined with recursive
functions and there are some basic techniques of its use that should be
learned. Study people code from other threads as well.

To understand Torsten's code you will need to understand the  experimental
features <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/WIP>   of the 
latest snapshot version <http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html>  . 

Finally, to understand tail recursion technique in OpenSCAD read the thread
on  Tail recursion <http://forum.openscad.org/Tail-recursion-td17040.html> 
.

Thorsten, 

you are cheating. You use the only imperative backdoor OpenSCAD is equipped
with ;-)
Giving examples like this might suck all desperate OpenSCAD programmers
forever into a little black hole. Once pandora's box has been opened ... 
I can see endlessly nested and expanded C-style for-loops coming up like
black clouds on the horizon.

Yeah, it's possible to abuse it and make horrible code, but
that's probably true for most constructs in pretty much all
languages.
Right now the feature is still marked as experimental so it
would not go automatically into the next release, so there's
still a chance to discuss it. But it seems to help expressing
some things easily that require much more effort from people
who are not so much into functional programming.

You also said: "Yeah, summing up things with OpenSCAD is
not real fun."

Which language construct could make it fun again? With
the current list of language changes, it might be easy
to just add another change if it makes things easier.

ciao,
  Torsten.

No I was comparing my second version of rel_2_abs with the first version
with your non-recursive sum_list.

That is probably because adding to the end of a list is proportional to the
length of the list when it involves a new memory allocation and then a
copy. I expect that becomes dominant when the list gets big.

Perhaps list comprehensions have some way of growing the list without
copying it as the list being built is expected to grow.

Ok, but this languages offer proper constructs, which are neglected for
horribleness, OpenSCAD doesn't.

Good point. Seriously spoken, I'd be happy to have this imperative backdoor
as a feature to do exactly what you do, but NOT within the head of the
forloop. Say as a feature of let: 

<code>
echo (pandora(10));  

function pandora(n) = 
 let(a = 1)
 [for (i=[1:n]) 
   let(a = a+i) [i, a]]; 
</code>

Currently this code answers with functional semantics: 
[[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 6], [6, 7], [7, 8], [8, 9], [9, 10],
[10, 11]]
so it uses outer scope 'a' as R-value set an inner scope L-value 'a'. 

with imperative semantics you'd obviously get (and that's the aim of the
game):
[[1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 7], [4, 11], [5, 16], [6, 22], [7, 29], [8, 37], [9,
46], [10, 56]]

To discriminate between definition (with implicit declaration) and (now
forbidden) update of a local outer (or even inner) scope variable, pandora
could introduce a 'set' keyword for the new semantics. And the expression
with imperative semantics would be: 

<code>
function pandora(n) = 
 let(a = 1)
 [for (i=[1:n]) 
   set(a = a+i) [i, a]]; 
</code>

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Programmatic export to stl from OpenSCAD sketch
Message-ID: <1464300646831-17437.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hello,

An idea/feature request.

Normally I have a number of different 3d-models in same openscad sketch
defined as modules called in global area like:

part1();
//part2();
//part3();

module part1(){...} 
module part2(){...}
module part2(){...}

When export to STL, uncomment part1, comment part2 and part3, press F6,
select export to STL from menu, enter file name, save. Then comment part1,
uncomment part2 etc. Quite toilsome updating export for design with many
parts.

This could be much nicer to export all parts in one batch by calling
something like:

export(file="export/part1.stl") part1();
export(file="export/part2.stl") part2();
export(file="export/part3.stl") part3();

thank's

Here is my proposal for how this would work:
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/1608

For your example, the syntax would be:

part("part1") part1();
part("part2") part2();
part("part3") part3();

If you export this as STL, you'll get a file dialog where you specify the
output directory, then 3 STL files are created in that directory
(part1.stl, part2.stl, part3.stl).

If you export this as AMF, then all 3 parts are output as separate named
objects within a single AMF file.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] puzzlecutlib rendering problem & STL export error
 Current top level object is empty.
Message-ID: <1464382196907-17440.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi:

Hoping some one can help me out. I did search for this error, and did find
other people with similar problem but no real solution that applies to my
problem.

I have downloaded puzzlecutlib.scad from thiniverse in order to cut up an
stl model that is slightly too big for my 3D printer. I was able to get the
puzzle cut where I wanted it after a bit of tweaking of the code. Including
changing the "child" statements in the library file to "children" to
eliminate one error. I also modified the puzzlecutdemo2.scad and added
translate([70,0,-22]) at the bottom of the code that imports the stl because
the model was importing in the wrong alinement with the puzzle cut.

I now have it just the way I want it. But I have a problem rendering it. I
get this error with F6:

"Compiling design (CSG Tree generation)...

I seem to have solve that error by saving the file with a new name. I now
get a different error, I can not see the model after hitting F6 unless I
select preview. And I get this error when I try to export to STL:

"Current top level object is empty. " when trying to export as STL.

Hi

Use  operator "!" before the part you want to export.

Your STL is probably invalid, check it with Netfabb Basic, or share it here.

The F6 is cached, so you don't get the error again unless you clear cache or
exit/rerun OpenSCAD. (a flaw IMO).
Object is empty because F6 failed.

Hi MichaelAtOz:

The stl file I am trying to use the puzzlecut plugin on originally came from
netfabb. So the stl should be valid. I'll attach all the files I am using
below. Hopefully you can see the error.

I don't see the problem, but then again I'm fairly new to OpenSCAD.

I even asked the author of the plugin, but he has not posted anything on his
block for nearly a year. So seems like he is MIA. Thanks.

Well the STL doesn't show any issues in Meshlab or Netfabb Basic.
But doing 

translate([60,10,-10]) 
import("td17440 Cycl_XleftFrame-base_cut2.stl");
cube([10,20,5]);

Causes the error. So CGAL doesn't like it.
The error '->plane()).is_degenerate() ' points to degenerate faces, but
these usually are detected by Netfabb.
Meshmixer says it has repaired the file, but unfortunately it doesn't tell
what it did or what was wrong.

So I ran it thru  Netfabb online <https://netfabb.azurewebsites.net/>   and
it now works.

Here is the fixed file  td17440_Cycl_XleftFrame-base_cut_fixed.stl
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n17444/td17440_Cycl_XleftFrame-base_cut_fixed.stl>

Hi MichaelAtOz:

I looked at the td17440_Cycl_XleftFrame-base_cut_fixed.stl file and it did
not have the puzzle cuts. So I opened in OpenSCAD and tried to render and
then export to stl. Here is the result:

As you can see I am still getting the CGAL error along with the object is
empty error when I try to export. I should mention I am using OpenSCAD
version 2015.03-2. And I'm on a 32bit version of windows. Did you try
exporting the part with the puzzle cuts to stl? Or did you just run the
unmodified stl through netfabb online?

There are endless reports of problems similar to this. Sometimes you can 
work around it using MeshLab or other tools, quite often you can not.

For some explanations and opinions around why this is a recurring 
problem, see for example this thread:

Hi Parkinbot. I have accepted your challenge, and designed a way to add
mutable variables to OpenSCAD without violating the declarative semantics.

The benefit is: it's easier to port traditional algorithms to OpenSCAD,
because now you can use standard imperative idioms. For example, you can
implement an efficient quicksort with in-place array update.

The drawback is: more language complexity. OpenSCAD is now a hybrid of a
declarative language with an imperative language.

I honestly don't know if we actually want to make this change. Do we want
to turn OpenSCAD into a general purpose programming language? However, it's
worth having the discussion, since the topic is often raised in the forum,
so I wrote a design paper to show people what this would look like.

Well you're getting different CGAL errors. The object will always be empty
with CGAL errors.

I didn't try puzzlecut.
I ran your STL thru Netfabb online, then used it with my code above, to
confirm that the error '->plane()).is_degenerate() ' was fixed.

So puzzlecut is now getting a different error;

ERROR: CGAL error in CGALUtils::applyBinaryOperator difference: CGAL ERROR:
assertion violation! Expr: cet->get_index() == ce->twin()->get_index() File:
/opt/mxe/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static/include/CGAL/Nef_3/SNC_external_structure.h
Line: 1169 

which I don't recall seeing before. So this is now beyond me.

Can someone else have a look. Fixed STL is above.

I cut the code back to a minimalish;

// Cut down version of below for testing
//OpenSCAD PuzzleCut Library Demo - by Rich Olson http://www.nothinglabs.com
//License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/

stampSize = [200,200,50];		//size of cutting stamp (should cover 1/2 of
object)

difference()
{
	rotate ([0,-90,90]) 
		translate([70,0,-22]) 
			import("td17440 Cycl_XleftFrame-base_cut_fixed.stl", convexity=8);
// -
	difference()
	{
		translate ([0,stampSize[0] / 2,0])
			cube (stampSize, center = true);
		// -
		translate([0,0,0])
			cube ([4, 8 ,stampSize[2]+2], center = true);
	}
}

In Meshlab it shows lots of self intersecting faces - the pink bits, (tho
not many when you let it unify duplicate faces)
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n17450/meshlab_si.jpg> 

You say OpenSCAD generated that STL? Can you share that?

Hi MichaelAtOz:

Thanks for the old college try. Seems like I've spent way too much of your
time and mine on this. What should have been a quick cut and export is
turning into a week frustration with no end in sight. Maybe you could
recommend another piece of software that would let me quickly break an STL
into two interlocking pieces? I have only two more parts this one and one
other to print so I can complete my project. And this problem preventing
from moving forward.

Hi Doug, 

that's a great paper. Thanks for accepting the challenge. It reads
interesting and I can almost smell the wind of progress, it will bring into
the language. I never really understood, why functions in OpenSCAD shouldn't
be imperative, as they provide a well defined interface to interact with
modules in a purely functional context. Your paper shows, that this path is
viable.

I'm not as deep into the matter as you are, so allow me some questions and
thoughts concerning some 'redundancies'.  
 
valof{ expr}; 
marks 'expr' as imperative. I understand it as the central modifier (context
switch) to annouce imperative code. However, as I read it, it will allow for
'mixed' semantics, which makes things complicated. For this reason more
markers have to be introduced. 

var x := expr; 
marks 'x' as mutable and will be allowed only within valof{} expressions.
Isn't 'valof{}' + 'var' + ':=' kind of triple marking? 'var' is ok in a
function/procedure prototype to mark output variables. 
In a non-mixed context 'let' and  '=' might have just overloaded semantics,
like in 'for' headers (more obvious in C-style), where mutable variables
also may be declared in common style.  

do{list}; 
is it used as a separator between both worlds? Wouldn't it be obsolet in a
non-mixture enviroment?

To be able to define functional semantics code within an imperative context,
some counterpart modifier could be introduced ... 

Rudolf

I was about to say "How much strength do you need? You could glue them. With
ABS two pieces joined with acetone are melted into one piece." but I tried a
simple split which failed too. 

It is a problem with the STL, I suspect other tools may have a problem too.
There are CAD tools you could use, but I'm not up to date on the best for
this. 
*Others here could suggest.*
You could export the makePuzzleStamp(cutLocations = cut); shape then try a
boolean in the CAD program.

For others. Cut down some more, note error occurs with intersection too;

stampSize = [170,100,50];		//size of cutting stamp (should cover 1/2 of
object)

//difference()
intersection()
{
	rotate ([0,-90,90]) 
		translate([70,0,-22]) 
			import("td17440 Cycl_XleftFrame-base_cut_fixed.stl", convexity=8);
// -
		translate ([0,stampSize[1] / 2,0])
			cube (stampSize, center = true);
		// -

}

Hi MichaelAtOz:

I thought about gluing the parts together, but I don't think that would work
very will with PLA. The parts are for the Cyclone PCB Factory. Basically a
mini milling machine for PCB's and other light materials like acrylic wood
etc.. The parts are for the X axis, so they need to be solid enough for
left-right motion and to support a Dremel on top. An interlocking cut would
make the two parts stronger than just glue. I suppose I could screw them
together. It just would have been so much more elegant to be able to make
the puzzle cut. You would think this problem comes up frequently enough that
some of the major 3D software publishers would have a built-in solution for
when a part is too big to print.

I replied with a version that works but it is blocked for being too long.

This repaired version seems to work. With Michael's version I got the error
message but instead of an empty object I got something that looked like the
original. I exported that and repaired it in Netfabb. That version will
then cut with Michael's test.

I just approved it, but didn't see it in the forum, but in the mailing list.
Hence above forum post, which seems to have worked.

Nophead, what version did you use to export that? (and I presume when you
say Michael's version you mean ..._fixed.stl?)

For me kisslicer is a good indicator tool to find out where a stl is
degenerate. This is what it indicates with your STL:

I used OpenScad 2015.05.16 (git e673fff).

Yes it came from your td17440_Cycl_XleftFrame-base_cut_fixed.stl. Netfabb
doesn't show any errors in that but once it has passed through OpenScad /
CGAL it shows 20 holes and 17 shells.

"blade edge sharp crease" is what it says and mostly results from numerical
errors. (Almost) degenerated triangles will most probably not show up as
'desired' in the sliced path. A closer look at the triangulation (CTRL+1)
unveals what has happend. 

Kisslicer indicates those errors, but silently gets around most of them.
Redness of colors indicate severity of errors.

First of all, I agree that the new syntax kind of sucks, and is not C-like.
That's a compromise which is required by the design goals I set for myself:
* backward compatibility
* preserve the meaning and declarative semantics of existing code

I couldn't change the meaning of existing syntax, so I had to invent all
new syntax for the bolted-on imperative programming extension. Maybe the
syntax is revolting enough to make the whole idea unacceptable.

Just to clarify, my proposal allows mutable variables to be defined and
used in any context:
* in the body of a function (that's where 'valof' is needed)
* in the body of a module, or in any {...} expression
* inside a list comprehension
* at the top level

Last month there was a forum post by Experimentalist asking why variables
don't work as they do in an imperative language:

>>>
module Test(choice = 1) {
    echo(choice=choice);
    myVar = 0;

    if (choice==1) {
        myVar = 1;
    } else if (choice == 2) {
        myVar = 2;
    } else {
         myVar = 3;
    }

    echo(myVar=myVar);
}
<<<

To rewrite this using the imperative programming extension:
>>>
module Test(choice = 1) {
    echo(choice=choice);
    var myVar := 0;

    if (choice==1) do {
        myVar := 1;
    } else if (choice == 2) do {
        myVar := 2;
    } else do {
         myVar := 3;
    }

    echo(myVar=myVar);
}
<<<

Why the weird syntax?

The 'var' keyword is needed to define a new mutable variable. The
definition syntax has to be different from the reassignment syntax, so that
the scope of a mutable variable can be determined. That's true in most
other imperative languages as well. Javascript uses almost the same syntax:
'var X = 0' to define variable X, and 'X = 1' to reassign it.

The ':=' operator is needed to distinguish 'myVar = 1', which defines a new
immutable variable with its own local scope, from 'myVar := 1', which
reassigns an existing mutable variable which is defined elsewhere.

The new 'do {...}' syntax is needed because the existing '{...}' syntax
doesn't have the same meaning it has in C: it's actually an expression that
constructs a 'group' data structure. You can see this by looking at the CSG
tree. Adding {...} to your code adds new groups to the CSG tree. This
distinction is probably not very important to most people right now, but it
becomes much more important in OpenSCAD2, where you start using {...}
expressions in all sorts of new contexts, like x = {...};

So the existing {...} is actually a kind of expression. Expressions need to
be referentially transparent (OpenSCAD is a declarative language), so they
can't modify mutable variables defined in an outer scope.

So I had to introduce the 'do {...}' syntax, which is a compound statement:
it has the same meaning as '{...}' does in C, Javascript and other C-like
imperative languages. As an alternative, I considered inventing a new kind
of bracket: {| ... |}, but it's hard to type and to pronounce.

I admit it is messed up to have a hybrid functional/imperative language
where the functional side is expressed using C syntax, and the imperative
side is expressed using non-C syntax. If backwards compatibility wasn't an
issue, it would be better to use '{...}' as the compound statement syntax,
instead of 'do {...}'.

I'd like to stress that 'do {...}' does not construct a data structure.
It's a kind of bracket that doesn't introduce nesting. That's potentially
useful in a list comprehension, or when generating geometry.

In a list comprehension,
  [ for (i=0:10:90) do { i, i+1 } ]
generates
  [ 0, 1, 10, 11, 20, 21, ... ]

This:
   if (true) {
      cube(10);
      sphere(6);
   }
wraps a group() around the cube and sphere, so it's equivalent to
   group() {
      cube(10);
      sphere(6);
   }
By contrast,
   if (true) do {
      cube(10);
      sphere(6);
   }
does not construct a new group(). Instead, it drops the cube and sphere at
the same level as the 'if' statement.

Message-ID: <1464551449603-17465.post@n5.nabble.com>

Doug, 

thanks for elaborating on your paper. I think I understood your thoughts by
having read your paper quite intensively. Ok, maybe not in all implications
and consequences, so please correct me, if I am getting on the wrong path,
when trying to explain my expectation while building upon your approach. 

Semantics is used to evaluate expressions and functions on the first hand,
which currently may appear in global, module and list comprehension context.
We are talking about two partially differing semantics and how they can
coexist. Let?s assume that OpenSCAD can be equipped with either of them,
without losing its declarative character, neither in mixed fashion. (This
will have to be shown, but not now, as we are still in a phase of 'creative
discussion'.)
 
If I was to implement a second semantics, I'd separate to two near to the
root of the syntax tree, and not near the leaves, as you try in your paper.
And I?d use an own parser for each of them for easy operator overload. (Of
course one would use a common parser with a slightly different language and
semantics, which has the same effect.) Think about the task of including
inline assembler code while programming the ?slow? code in C. 

So, for clearness, let's rename valof{} into imp{} and give it a counterpart
named func{}. Both serve as modifier to an expression (or a {}-list of
expressions), with func{} being the default to keep up compatibility with
*all* old code. In list comprehension we could use func[?] and imp[?]
respectively, instead of imp{[?]} - but possible omissions are already the
details.

Any function or module body is by default declared as func{}, which can also
be written explicitly for clearness. If a body is declared as func{},
variables are non-mutable i.e. value-overriding ? current functional
semantics. If a body is declared as imp{} any local variable declared in
this context will be mutable. Most notable difference: expressions like a =
a+1 will evaluate as 'expected'. Currently

> B = 1; 
> B = B+1; 
> echo (B);

is not allowed in global context, but in function context: 

> echo (test());      // ECHO: 2
> function test() = let (A = 1)  let (A = A+1) A; 

while is does ?strange? things, when used like this: 

> echo (test());      // ECHO: [1, 2, 3]
> function test() = let (A = 1) [for (i=[0:2]) let (A = A+i) A];

so if we defined test() like this

> echo (test());      // ECHO: [1, 2, 4]
> function test() = imp { let (A = 1) [for (i=[0:2]) let (A = A+i) A]};

the ?second? parser will regard 'A' as mutable and generate code with
imperative semantics. That means, variables will always be treated (typed)
according to the modifier of the scope they are introduced (think about a
?const? declaration in C++), and operators will be interpreted according to
the current scope modifier. The rule is: Outer scope mutable variables are
not mutable within code declared with func{} and outer scope non-mutable
variables are not mutable within code declared with imp{}. 

Mixed mode is easy to achieve. Any expression or statement list {?} will
?inherit? its modifier from its parent. So if global code is declared as
imp{}, all code will be parsed with imperative semantics and vice versa. Any
inherited modifier can be overridden to enforce either semantics for any
piece of code. So you can compose code using semantics in colorful mixture -
in sequenced and in structured layout.
 
Library code will have its own modifier - same rules apply. Thus ?legacy?
code, even if imported within a imp{} chunk, will be func{} by default.

Yes, it is turning into a Frankenstein's monster of a language.

No, I don't think we do. If this happens then the imperative programmers
will just wine about the limitation you have imposed and want more. There
are already OpenSCAD-esc imperative languages, OpenJSCAD etc, no need to
pollute this one.

Also, this would also inhibit parallelism, which I believe would be much
more beneficial.

So, thanks for opening the discussion, but, IMO no thanks...

This has been very interesting and I appreciate all the work Doug (and 
others) have put into this.
I would describe the resulting problem raised by mixing these two 
approaches into OpenSCAD as resulting in a syntax mish-mash (for want of 
a better term).

How about a slightly compromised way of thinking about it.

I know there is already some wrappers for OpenSCAD in other languages. 
What if OpenSCAD was more fully integrated into one of these languages. 
Lets choose Python for sake of the argument.

We would then gain the advantages of a fully defined imperative language 
with all of its data-structures etc. As well as the declarative 
structure of OpenSCAD.

To make this work better than existing implementations would involve 
making it easier to describe the final declarative description of the 
Tree. Current implementations basically construct a scad file, and 
execute it. But if we could evaluate and then interrogate the result 
within something like Python, then the advantages could be realised with 
less effort and ongoing maintenance etc.

We might even be able to get to the complex issues surrounding problems 
similar to (say) building an N-part mold of convex parts.

The advantage of choosing a single programming to language to integrate 
to is simply one of pragmatism. Of course the interface could be opened 
up to all.

I've thought about the language integration approach. The language I would
choose to integrate with would be C. Most industrial strength programming
languages, including Python, have some way to interoperate with C code. So,
the C API could be used as a bridge between languages.

Yeah, they are so demanding, once you give them an inch, they'll take a
mile. If they do not want to calculate sums in O(n?) by writing recursive
functions, they'd better go elsewhere.

Btw, isn't list-comprehension an imperative embedding? Is has brought so
much value - and new syntax - to OpenSCAD. Do you want to deny that? 

Your second argument is nuts. Parallelism and imperative elements is NOT an
either-or decision - especially not in a declarative embedding.

There's actually two issues in there. The main one is the "everything you
know about programming doesn't work here" experience that imperative
programmers experience when learning OpenSCAD. The other is performance.
The mutable variable proposal tries to address the first issue, but in it's
current state, it's a really ugly hack.

Performance is an independent issue. I'm doing some prototyping work to
build a really fast evaluator. The #1 most important thing, in my opinion,
is to compile OpenSCAD into a form that can be efficiently executed. That
includes optimizations, where high level patterns (like tail recursion) are
compiled into more efficient forms (like loops). I don't think mutable
variables will be required for performance, but we'll see. Measurement is
the final arbiter of truth.

> Btw, isn't list-comprehension an imperative embedding?

Yes, but only in OpenSCAD. This has been my main contribution so far:
making list comprehensions look like C code. In other programming
languages, list comprehensions are an ASCII-ized version of set builder
notation from mathematics.
Eg, math notation:
  { x? | x ? ? ? x ? 10 }
Haskell:
  [ x^2 | x <- [0..10] ]
OpenSCAD:
  [ for (x = [0:10]) pow(x,2) ]

Ditto for the still-experimental and not yet approved "C style for". It's
the result of defining a list library for OpenSCAD2, inspired by the
Haskell list library, but redesigned for ease of use. Haskell has an
'unfold' operation, which is potentially useful, but the interface is hard
to understand:

let fibonacci n =
   unfoldr (\(a,b) -> if a < n then Just (a,(b,a+b)) else Nothing) (0,1)

My big idea was that 'unfold' can be expressed using C syntax:

function fibonacci(n) =
   [for (a=0, b=1; a < n; t=a, a=b, b=t+b) a];

And once again, this *looks like* an imperative embedding. One of the
threads I've been pursuing, while working on OpenSCAD, is how to make
functional programming easier to use, and more acceptable to imperative
programmers.

Hi MichaelAtOz:

I see this attached STL actually compiles with no problems. What did you do
to the file? Or to the OpenSCAD code? Has an admin responded to your request
yet? If not, you can PM(not sure if this forum supports that) me and I'll
arrange an ftp upload if needed. Let me know. I actually will need to make
changes to my part, so having working OpenSCAD code or a work-around
procedure would be helpful. Thank you for the help :-)

Nophead loaded that STL saying  above "This repaired version seems to work.
With Michael's version [aka the ...fixed.stl] I got the error message but
instead of an empty object I got something that looked like the original. I
exported that and repaired it in Netfabb. That version will then cut with
Michael's test.".

I just loaded his STL after his post got held up, as I'm an Admin.

I just tried to reproduce what he did and can't get the same result (tho not
using his exact version). The STL still gets the error, and Netfabb doesn't
show any issues.

So sorry, not solved...

Does the version I upload work with the original code?

I think the root problem is the old bug that OpenScad cannot import STL
files with vertices that are close together because it snaps them to a grid
and breaks the topology. Until OpenScad can import STL files properly there
will be an endless stream of these reports.

Meshlab shows lots of self intersecting vertices. Fewer in the _fixed.stl.
But when ticking the 'unify' box on load there are none.
However, when exporting that (from meshlab), that STL still gets the CGAL
error.

With your hint, I changed it to;

module cutInTwo()
{
	scale(0.5)
		translate([0,-20,0])
			xMaleCut()
				rotate ([0,-90,90]) 
					scale(2)
						translate([55,-35,-16]) 
							import("td17440 Cycl_XleftFrame-base_cut_fixed.stl"
								, convexity=8);;
}

Which works. Seems the up scaled vertices are ok, so presumably it is the
NefPoly which has issues with the close vertices (if my vague understanding
is anywhere close). ?? clue

@ForthDr you will/may need to fiddle with the translate()'s as the scale(2)
moves the object. 

The scale() change did not fix the degenerate issue, so you will need to run
the STL thru Netfabb online if you get that error.

Hi nophead:

I took the STL (nopheads_repaired.stl) that MichaelAtOz posted for you and
plugged it into the original puzzlecutdemo2.scad using the original
puzzlecutlib.scad library and the file rendered just fine. It also exported
to stl no problems. So, what can I do to get revisions of this part to do
the same without any problems?

Hi Parkinbot. Thanks for reading the paper and making comments. I updated
the Mutable Variables design doc, somewhat along the lines that you
suggested. The keyword 'do' is now consistently used to switch into the
imperative sublanguage, and {...} is now a compound statement in the
imperative language, as desired. I got rid of the 'call' keyword, so that a
procedure call is just 'p(x);'. So the syntax is more C-like, less
surprising.

The original paper made it possible for a library to export a mutable
variable defined at the top level. That was a bad mistake, it's fixed.
Mutable variables can now only be defined locally within a 'do' block or a
procedure definition.

I kept the ':=' operator because it's important to make a clear distinction
between reassigning a mutable variable, and defining an immutable variable.
We can't use '=' for both, otherwise it will be very confusing, and we'd
theoretically have a lot of forum posts asking why x=x+1 works in some
contexts and fails in other contexts. For what it's worth, Pascal and a lot
of related languages use '=' for defining constants and ':=' for
reassigning a mutable variable, so my syntax is consistent with that.

I think the new design is simpler and cleaner. The imperative sublanguage
is now more cleanly segregated. However, MichaelAtOz's main objection still
stands, it's still a hybrid language (aka "Frankenstein monster"), so I
think it is unlikely that this will be implemented.

Doug.

What do you mean by 'get revisions of this part'?

Do you mean you want to do something to that STL, like add a hole or chop
off an end?

If so you can do something like;

difference()
{
	translate([52.254,16.372,-9.77]) // close to origin
		import("nopheads repaired.stl", convexity=8);
// -
	translate([-15,40,20])
	#rotate([0,90,0])
		cylinder(r=2,h=20,$fn=18);
}

If the original STL is generated by OpenScad then you can remove the close
vertices. If you post the code I can have a look at it. If you look at the
triangulation there seem to be far too many triangles to tessellate such a
simple shape. In particular these look very suspicious.




Another solution would be to apply the puzzle cut directly to the OpenScad
object to avoid exporting it to STL and reading it back in again, which in
general doesn't work with OpenScad.

Doug, 

yeah the design now looks a lot simpler and straight forward. I'd be able to
live with it, so please take my annotations as suggestions to keep the
discussion going on. 
There is by far no Frankenstein monster coming up. Hey, even Mac OS can be
run on PC-hardware meanwhile and the world is still revolving. Escaping the
'const' restrictions and random write access is unavoidable for a modern
language, as to many inelegant and time consuming work arounds have to be
used to accomplish even simple tasks like summing up or matrix manipulation. 

Also I wouldn't sweep Neon's argument from the carpet to use a full grown
language in declarative embedding. I'm just afraid, this will take away most
of the fun the dev team is having to create an own thing. If I had time, I'd
try to blow up Matlab with a toolbox written in native C++ that can act as a
fast OpenGL viewer at CSG level. I guess such a component is already
available and its just a question of interfacing. By building on an already
mighty language you can concentrate on the important things. Blender ist a
good example for this approach. Also similar approaches, not being so much
overloaded, are currently popping up. 

Personally I'm still not very happy with the keyword 'do' which is being
used for procedural things (mainly oops) in other languages. But, it has an
imperative connotation. So why not. 

Also having '=' and ':=' in the same language for assignments, WILL be
confusing, anyway you look at it. I started programming with ALGOL68, where
':=' was used solely for variable declaration with init, while later
reassignments where done with '='. This is, what your 'var' keyword does.
Later I was programming in Pascal/Delphi/C++/VB in a kind of mixed fashion
and I really got crazy about this, especially when trying to reuse code that
crossed borders. 

But in those (imperative) languages immutable (=const) variables just are
not allowed to be noted as L-values. It is a bit misleading and hard to
understand for novices (or mainly imperative programmers, like me) that
immutable variables are allowed as L-values after first use in OpenSCAD and
that the last assignment will kind-of supersede all other assignments, while
some scoping rules (that only seem to be perfectly known only by the
interpreter :-) ) are enforced for expressions like A = A+1. As far as I
remember, those rules have changed over time, and it was not allowed in
earlier versions, but it has somehow drippled in und I guess has to be kept
for compatibility reasons. 

Maybe I am wrong with all this, because I never started to seriously use
this language for productive things nor did any documentation on it. Usually
I struggle my way through, writing also a lot superfluous test code and
stuff, to find out interrogatively which opinion a compiler or interpreter
has on certain expressions - at least in lack of a debugger. But this just
as background, because most multi-language users (who is not in our days?)
will be in the same 'Babylonian' situation. 

I'd still say

function myfunc = do{
var x := 1; 
... 

is triple marking. But better than nothing :-) Omitting things in later
versions is better than having forgot crucial things in earlier versions.

Hi Parkinbot. Just a note about constant vs variable declarations.

In Algol 68:
  real pi = 3.1416;    // constant declaration
  real x := 0;             // variable declaration, initialized to 0
  x := x + 1;              // assignment statement
In Pascal:
  const pi = 3.1416;  // constant declaration
  var x := 0;               // variable declaration
  x := x + 1;               // assignment statement
In Javascript:
   const pi = 3.1416;
   var x = 0;
   x = x + 1;
In OpenSCAD (with mutable variables)
   pi = 3.1416;    // constant declaration
   var x := 0;       // variable declaration
   x := x + 1;       // assignment statement

There is no imperative language that uses the same syntax for both a
constant declaration and for an assignment statement. It's too late to
change OpenSCAD to use a different syntax for constant declarations. So I
can't use '=' for the assignment statement.

You said: "It is a bit misleading and hard to
understand for novices (or mainly imperative programmers, like me) that
immutable variables are allowed as L-values after first use in OpenSCAD and
that the last assignment will kind-of supersede all other assignments"

That's a design flaw in the language, which I propose to fix.

It's a side effect of an important feature. You can include a script that
contains a top level constant declaration X, then you override the value of
X in the parent script.
   include <lib.scad>  // defines X
   X = 1;   // override X

The problem is that the include statement just mashes the included file
into the same input stream as the parent, and OpenSCAD doesn't tag constant
declarations with the original source file in which they are defined
(yet--Marius has a branch that will fix this).
So we have no way to issue an error message for
   X = 0;
   X = 1;
because the first X=0 *could* have originated in an include file, and the
second X=1 *could* be an override in the parent, we just don't know.

Once Marius merges his branch, then it will be possible to issue a warning
or error message for a duplicate constant declaration, both in the same
source file, and we can stop pretending that this is legal code.

Try this:

In C++
   const double pi = 3.1416;  // constant declaration
   double x = 0;              // variable declaration, initialized to 0
   x = x + 1;                 // assignment statement

In Angelscript:
   const double pi = 3.1416;  // constant declaration
   double x = 0;              // variable declaration, initialized to 0
   x = x + 1;                 // assignment statement

Oh my god, half of my Algol68 is gone ;-) I admit I could have looked it up.
I just remember there were monster terms like 'REF REAL x = LOC REAL := pi'
from which most parts could be omitted. But anyway, the main problem was the
struggle with the punch cards ... 

The difference is all about modifiers and not about the operator, which can
easily be overloaded for each modifier (as it is for the different data
types). But never mind, ':=' is not such a bad deal and you are on the safer
side. Lazy people like me prefer to write Tx(10) instead of translate([10,
0, 0]) and to use short variable names like 'x' plus maybe a comment on
first use, instead of 'My_Main_Diameter_For_Circular_Integration' but this
is really a matter of taste.

So putting

globally into a lib, can be nasty, especially if the included lib does the
'use'. But this leads into the qualifier discussion, which should not be
neglected.

This is a bug, it causes pain to lots of people. I think the problem is
that we cache the result of a failed import. I think the fix is to not
cache anything if the import fails.

Or cache the console strings with the geometry they correspond to and emit
them whenever the geometry is used from the cache. There are lots of
warnings that only emit once, not just import.

Hi MichaelAtOz:

This is what I was originally doing before I got mired in OpenSCAD error
messages. I am building a milling machine. I have all but 2 of the 3D
printable parts printed. The two parts that are too big to print are already
in stl format. I was experimenting with where to cut the part to maximize
strength when rejoining the parts. So I first opened one of the stl files in
netfabb(5.1.2, since have upgraded to v7) and made a few cuts. I then opened
the stl in OpenSCAD to use the puzzlecut library. Once I had the puzzle cut
in what I thought was the right place, I tried to render and export back to
stl. Once that was done I was going to open the stl in netfabb again and
rejoin the parts. This way I would then have the puzzle cut where I needed
it. There where over hangs so that is why I was cutting first, then
puzzling, then rejoining. Here are the original stl files before any
changes:

Cycl_XleftFrame.stl
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n17491/Cycl_XleftFrame.stl>  
Cycl_XrightFrame.stl
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n17491/Cycl_XrightFrame.stl>  

As you can see, these parts are too long on one dimension for a 150mm^3
printing volume  My idea was to puzzle the base in such a way to shorten the
object to fit while at the same time making the pieces fit together so the x
and y movement would not cause the parts to come apart.

If you're printing in ABS, solvent welds are very strong in my
experience. I do sometimes add alignment features though, like a short
pin and hole, to make sure the bond doesn't go askew. But large ABS
prints are prone to warping if you don't have a heated building chamber.
Sometimes you can print as mirror symmetrical half parts that can be
bonded back to back to cancel out warps.

Hi David B. Gustavson:

I'm printing is PLA. No heated bed at the moment. That is on my to-do list.

I can see where the crazy tessellation comes from now. There is a fan of
triangles for the simicircular cutout in the tall part that you have
removed. Netfabb is a mesh editor so it just truncates the fan of triangles
leaving some very close vertices. OpenScad can't handle close vertices.

Does it work if you puzzlecut the whole part rather than a section of it
made with Netfabb?

Those are not the same syntax -- the constant declarations have "const" in
front (and the same for the Javascript example), and the assignment doesn't
:-)

Without const they would not be constant declarations. If you want a 
variable declaration, then drop the const. The constant declaration 
syntax using '=' is the same as for variable declarations and 
assignments, unlike the other examples.

My point is that simple concepts should ideally be expressed directly 
and consistently, not in subtle and indirect ways that few will 
understand and accept.

Unfortunately those original files have the problem. They are degenerate.
Unfortunately when run thru Netfabb online they then get the other CGAL
error. I can't see a way to fix them.

Perhaps get someone with a bigger printer to print them for you??
