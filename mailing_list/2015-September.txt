True, I was trying an extra push for echof() ;) ...

I will give some thought to wording. The real challenge is the short summary
on the cheat sheet.  I need to play with % to learn what it does, then start
a new thread so we can kick around ideas.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Modifier Characters on Cheat Sheet
Message-ID: <1441117352201-13681.post@n5.nabble.com>

OpenScad has 4 modifier characters which can be applied to groups as well as
primitive objects. The challenge is providing short description for the
cheat sheet.
Currently these are:

Modifier Characters
*    disable
!     show only
#    highlight / debug
%   transparent / background

For discussion I propose the the following which changes 3 of the 4:

Modifier Characters
*    disable
%   disable, leave grey ghost
!     use only
#    highlight transparent pink

These may be based on a misunderstanding of some of them.

Hi Doug,

I was out traveling for a long while, but back again now.
Catching up on OpenSCAD issues, but hopefully able to contribute to this again soon.
Drop me a note if there are anything in particular you?re looking for now, or if I should just start reviewing it top-down.

I haven't touched this since July 9; I had started to make some changes to
fix design flaws in the scoping rules, but ran out of steam before I
finished incorporating that change and cleaning up the document. The worst
problem is that I started writing a new RFC called "Scoping Rules for
Scripts" but ran out of energy before I finished it. The missing text is
where I prove that the design is sound.

However, this is a small problem, relatively speaking. You are welcome to
read the document and provide feedback. I did get feedback from 2 other
people who read the whole thing (in a previous version), but none of that
feedback was transformative, in the sense of pointing out real problems, or
pointing out fundamentally better approaches. The only good transformative
feedback I've ever received was from you. So I'm interested in hearing what
you have to say.

Right now I'm working through some medical issues, and don't have a lot of
energy: mostly the problem is that my arm hurts, so I can't do large
amounts of typing right now. But I can still read, think and answer
questions.

And https://github.com/openscad/MCAD/blob/dev/fasteners/threads.scad which is my
rewritten version of that using sweep() instead of polyhedrons. It renders a lot
faster and supports other trapezoidal thread profiles (ACME, buttress), while
allowing for custom trapezoidal thread forms to be generated easily.

Oh, I forgot to mention, my version honours the $fs/$fa/$fn setting, so you
might need to increase the resolution from OpenSCAD's defaults to get nicely
formed threads. I recommend $fs=0.4 and $fa=1.

I am having a similar issue.

Can you confirm that we can't render colors at all with union?

I have 10 cubes of different colors. After render with union, the display
has no colors. Do the STL files save without colors for different vertices??

This is an interesting project done at MIT using OpenSCAD, where they

One thing missing from OpenSCAD, needed by this project, is the ability to

recent thread, "Quit or Exit function?", that discusses this deficit.

As a general approach, it looks interesting. However, in typical academic
fashion, it lacks practicality. They precompute data sets to make later
operations faster. That is a pretty standard CS technique, but the simplest
model took 1 day of CPU time, and the most complex 22 days, and also
produced up to 15GB or so of cached data.

So while they criticise Thingiverse, Thingiverse probably have thousands of
models. Precomputing the data and storing large amounts of data would be a
significant overhead. Researchers might get their 40 Amazon cores cheap or
free, but others have to pay.

So yeah, if you throw CPU and memory at a problem you can do it quicker.
What would be novel is to find a way to do it without incurring a lot of
overhead.

Obviously the press release is a puff piece, but it doesn't mention all the
third-party work they built their stuff on.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Working around CGAL color limitations,
	mesh post processing.
Message-ID: <1441440198008-13698.post@n5.nabble.com>

Presently OpenSCAD doesnt support color render files.

Industry standard seems to be VRML2 and X3D, either color polygons or UV
colors.

I'm thinking of putting together a code which can compare the triangles of
an original colored mesh and the openscad CGAL mesh, find matching vertices
and coincident polygons, and color them based on the input file. 

That is where it gets complex, perhaps you can provide advice on different
coincident-polygon comparisons, and potential pitfalls.

First I have to obtain openscad STL and the colored mesh so that they can
exist in the same mesh engine, with a list of triangles and vertices and
colors in arrays. 

We already have that within openscad, except that i am a n00b programmer so
i would probably code it on another mesh engine. Then i have to get a VRML2
conversion code. I have to compare every polygon in one mesh to every
polygon in another mesh, to see if they exist on the same plane? If yes, to
see if they overlap as triangles? If they do share the same space then it's
safe to presume that they should be the same color, and thus to color the
entire openscad mesh and save it as VRML2.

Please advise me on the difficulties of the task? :) Is there any reason why
CGAL won't one day implement a similar post processing for colored mesh?

Wiki says that X3D is the newest generation of VRML format. Meshlab and
Blender source code perhaps contain good examples of X3D file conversion. I
have found a conversion code for unity3D called unityx3d, so i could
probably do it all in Unity3d in a couple of days, the result would be a bit
impractical.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] evenly cutting two curves to make surfaces
Message-ID: <1441450841195-13702.post@n5.nabble.com>

I'm trying to loft between a simple line and a complex curve and make a
"nice" set of regular faces.
I.e. two curves with quite different parameterisation. E.g. a straight line
100mm long and a parallel but highly wavy line, 100mm long.

In order to generate polygons between them, I'd like to be able to cut the
curve and the straight line into (say) 30 segments.
The curved line will have unequal length segments in most curve basis
systems (e.g. Bezier).
But I'd like them to be nearly the same so I get a nice regular surface.

Does anyone know of an OpenSCAD lib that allows me to define a curve and a
straight line, and when broken into segments, cuts linearly along the path
rather than linearly through (say) knot values or other non-linear
mechanisms ?

Personally I think this is a stopgap measure until - as they have indicated -
OpenSCAD eventually supports this feature (primarily for multiple
extruders).
So I'd have to say use a simple format to do this and not such a complex
format.
Specifically I suggest obj, or the proposed amf, as an export. But it
depends on what your final use is for this file and what that app needs.
 - IMHO VRML1,2 is out and X3D is a massive pile 99% of which you don't
need.
 - OBJ is read by everyone especially if you keep it simple which in this
case I believe it would be.

It sounds a little complicated, I'm not sure if it would work. Where is the
original colored mesh derived from?

I have a version of OpenSCAD which implements rendered color, it use Carve
library so is also quite a bit faster than CGAL, although several useful
features of CGAL are not supported such as hull, minkowski. It can output
multiple STLs (one per color), or an AMF with one color per volume. I would
like to add other formats such as X3D.

To guide development it would be useful to have more use cases. So if you
have any sample models, and what the output mesh is to be used for, please
let me know.

Don't know if there's any lib, but I  want to do this for a while (if I
understand your question correctly). I've thought of an approach, just
haven't got time to do it. So this is what I would do:

1) Assume we got these bezier pts (the cubic Bezier pts, as red dots)
through the line segments, ABCDE, as shown below:

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13707/forum_1596_smooth_curves_.png>  

in which intervals between red dots are uneven. The challenge is to make
them more or less even.

2) The first order approach is to make more red dots for longer line
segments at the time of their generation, based on the observation that the
intervals are proportional to the line segment length; This would probably
get most of the job done.

3) Further refinement needs to take into account the curvature, for example,
the curve between B-C would need more red dots than that between A-B. This
is decided by 2 control handlers (and other parameters) needed to calc the
Bezier curve. So at the time of calc Bezier pts, take this into account and
make more pts as needed.

Love the new front end, makes things very easy to use.

There is one thing that I would love to see. We now have icons across the
top of the editor. We also have the very useful cheat sheet. Would it be
possible to link the two to save typing and syntax errors. I think it would
make things very simple for newbies and get them on board.

I have a template at the top of which is a commented out list of all of my
most commonly used commands. I just copy and paste the commands into my code
whenever I need them.

Eg
translate([0,0,0])rotate([0,0,0])cube([0,0,0],center=true);

If I don't need to 'translate' or 'rotate' I just leave the values as '0'.
If there was a simple icon bar at the top that allowed me to select
cylinder, cube, sphere etc etc all that I would need to do is click on it to
get the command to create the shape, and then enter the parameters. No
syntax errors, and no trying to figure out where the mysterious errors are.

I use openscad to design plastic models with multiple parts that are 3D
printed separately due to print bed constraints. So my code is in module
format, and I just have a list of modules at the end, and comment out the
ones I am not printing prior to exporting to STL.

Probably pushing the boat out with this additional request, but if Openscad
could identify module names, and hold them in a drop down list, it would be
great to just click on the module that I wanted to export, name it, and
export it.

It's a great tool, took me a while to get to grips with it, but use it daily
now.

Hi Bobc, a carve version sounds ingenous. There is color by vertex and by
polygon and by uvs, i have found that PLY also does color by vertex, it's a
surprise to me, i was just thinking of color by triangle only because it is
a clear contrast. Shapeways seems to only accept vrml2 and x3d files for
color. It's to render any kinds of unions made with different color cubes. i
was hoping to print variations of this code in color:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/114667999/randfms.scad

Neon22, yes it's a bit unwieldy x3d given all the xml, ill have to triple my
magnesium supplements prior to reading the specifications doc :D I will have
to read what they say on the discussion page as it sounds confusing. It's
much more difficult for me to understand a programming library to find where
the triangles and indices are kept than to actually write code to compare
all the source file triangles to the rendered file and copy the rendered
file ones so that they are the same as the input colors.

or use a parameterisation that counts equal distances along eth actual
resultign curve. I know this is easier in some base matrices than others.

My problem is specifically this
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13710/curves.png> 
The two lines have widely varying sampling as a result of their curvature. I
want to make a mesh between them so a slicing like the red lines is better
for me than the current slicing which is the blue dots.

but sounds like no clear existing solution :(

I like the features of the new editor too, but I don't use it.  I like the
autocomplete and in-line help offered by my thing
<http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:167899> for use in Notepad++ as an
external editor.  I haven't noticed any other editors that offer both for
OpenSCAD.

When I type 'tr' it opens the following drop-down list:

*translate ([*
*translate ([0, 0, 0])*
*translate ([0, 0, 0]) cube (size = [1, 1, 1]);*
*translate ([0, 0, 0]) cylinder (h =*
*translate ([0, 0, 0]) rotate (a = [0, 0, 0]) cube (size = [1, 1, 1]);*
*translate ([0, 0, 0]) rotate (a = [0, 0, 0]) cylinder (h =*


This is much like your commented list, except that it is available at a few
keystrokes rather than a copy-and-paste.  And there are similar lists for
nearly every keyword, where appropriate. I don't include 'center' in the
above list, because it has it's own autocomplete with 'ce'.

Typing 'rotate(' opens the following tooltip:

*rotate ()*
*rotate (a = [x, y, z]) {...} - rotates the object 'a' degrees around the
origin.*
*Also: rotate (a = deg, v = [x, y, z]) {...} - rotates the object 'a'
degrees around the axis specified by the vector.*

And again, nearly every keyword is represented.

I could never get the autocomplete/tooltip files to work with any Notepad++
version later than 6.5.3, but all older versions are available on the
Notepad++ website. At least for OpenSCAD, I haven't noticed that newer
versions offer anything significant.

I'm a pretty inexperienced user of OpenSCAD, so the autocomplete lists
reflect what I've found useful.  I'm sure there are many entries that could
be added - I'd welcome suggestions.

points ?

It looks like that you do have a function, otherwise the top line won't be a
curve with just 3 dots.

Hi Gary, thanks for your notepad++ work. I did a remix and it works for me in
6.8.1.
The autocomplete & inline help is great.
The other thing I value in notepad++ is the auto highlighting of identical
words. So if I mark a variable (say) then by scrolling I can see everywhere
that variable is used without additional keystrokes.

Yes I've oversimplified that. I'm happy to generate the curve in any way at
all.
E.g. In inkscape and export as a series of straight line segs, or as XY knot
points, manually by examination in OpenSCAD, or any other way :)
Cheers...

Hi Neon, your answer is not clear ... "you are happy to generate the curve",
or "you already are able to generate the curve"?

Instead of attempting to get an verbal understanding of where the difficulty
really is, why don't you just show some data? That would make help come much
easier.

I am sorry I cannot make myself understood. I am prepared to make the curve
in any way at all if I can get the end result.
In the interests of continued discussion here is a sample below.
Two curves exported from Inkscape and - here - shown as rotate_extrudes.

However the result I am looking for would have these two curves alternating
around the circumference of the rotated volume. Wavy, then smooth, then
wavy, then smooth, etc...
The resulting volume would have smooth and wavy sections in a single volume.

You can use projection to have the system find the widest parts along an
axis. This can be used to make a two part mold.
However AFAIK this projection can't be used as e.g. a series of points to go
into a further polygon operation.
In fact I don't think it can be examined in any way... but someone else may
know an approach ?

Gary, I think you will find the problem with the newer version of NP++ is it
doesn't like spaces in the keyword. I just removed the spaces, not ideal for
how I like to format it.

I mentioned it on the NP++ forum some time ago, but they are not as
responsive as this place.

Is this what you want to do?

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13723/PartingLine.png> 

And you want to do this automatically?

Note: there is not always a solution to your problem.
---- Code ____
r1=30;
r2=20;

x1=90;
z1=30;

rc=10;

rp=2;


module sphere1(r1=r1){
    sphere(r1);
    color("red")
    rotate_extrude()translate([r1,0,0])circle(rp);
}


sphere1();
translate([x1,0,z1])sphere1();

hull(){
    sphere(rc);
    translate([x1,0,z1])sphere(rc);
}

color("red"){
    hull(){
        translate([0,-rc,0])sphere(rp);
        translate([x1,0,z1])translate([0,-rc,0])sphere(rp);
    }
    hull(){
        translate([0,+rc,0])sphere(rp);

That's pretty close. You have 6 of each I think.
However the transition between them is not smooth. It is stepped. That is
why I'm trying to do it with the same number of segments in each of the two
curves.
My curves above are IIRC 124 segments for the wavy and 60 for the smooth.
If they were both 124 then I could make a smooth transition between curves
by stitching faces.

I can simulate it by scaling two 90 degree out of phase objects but these
are arbitrary attempts to solve a basic problem of curve paramaterisation.

E.g. If I had a bspline (or any other basis function curve) with 4 knots and
another with 2. How do I get the same number of segments(of even length)
when sampling them.

I wonder if you could take that, use projection() (not the cut version) and
then extrude that shape back up and difference the entire thing. Just an
idea - will try later...

Unfortunately this results in a plane.  I need a non-planar surface as the
result.  That then needs to be turned into a solid to subtract from the
original object.

That is similar to what I want but that is not it.  How would you generate a
parting line for this?
---- Code ____
 hull() {
   sphere(10);
   translate([15,0,10]) sphere(10);
 }
 hull() {
   translate([15,0,10]) sphere(10);
   translate([45,0,0]) sphere(10);
 }

Hi Neon, it seems that your problem can be approached with simple
interpolation, based on the observation that each line segment between two
points is, or nearly is, a straight line. 

The following is the smooth_points[25] to [26] of your data (blue). Just
increase the y by dy (set to 2.35 here) repeatedly (red horizontal lines),
see if it gets larger than any given smooth_points[i].y. If yes, calc the
slope between  smooth_points[i] and [j] (green). The interpolated point at
that y can thus be obtained (I250, I251 and I261). 

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13729/interpolation_1597_Neon22.png> 

Here are the functions that generate the I250, I251 and I261 in the above
graph:


> function slope(pts,i)=
>      (pts[i+1][1]-pts[i][1] ) / (pts[i+1][0]-pts[i][0] );
> 
> function interpolate( pts, i, y=begY )=
>      let( slope= slope( pts, i ) )
>      [ pts[i][0]+ (y-pts[i][1])/slope, y ];
> 
> I250= interpolate( smooth_points, 25);
> I251= interpolate( smooth_points, 25, y=begY+dy);
> I260= interpolate( smooth_points, 26, y=begY+dy*2);

This is to answer your question in the first post. To reach your final
destination, more manipulations are needed. But lets see how you will take
it from here.

Your wavy curve doesnt stick out much over the smooth curve.
So I scaled the smooth body by scale([.9,.9,1])

If you can cut your curve into concave sections, you can just chain-hull
while rotating around the z axis, scaling the wave curve while you rotate
around.

When you set

r1=10;
r2=10;

in my code your getting pretty close.

But do you want to do this automatically for arbitrary .stl's, or do you
want to do it with simple shapes, as in the example.

And one more thing to consider: what do you want to do with this "parting
line".

In my example it is a 3d shape.

My geues you want it to cut your molde in two (or more) parts.

Here is a quick and dirty way to do it with arbitrarry shapes.
(This cound be impruved by using the 2d commands for growing and shrinking
2d-shapes)


?

 eps=0.999;


 module shape(){
     hull() {
       sphere(10);
       translate([15,0,10]) sphere(10);
     }
     hull() {
       translate([15,0,10]) sphere(10);
       translate([45,0,0]) sphere(10);
     }
 }

module proj(){projection()shape();}

scale([2-eps,2-eps,1])color("red")
intersection(){
translate([0,0,-50])linear_extrude(convexity=6)
difference(){
    proj();
    scale([eps,eps])proj();
}

    shape();
}

shape();

That is getting closer.  I just need the red part to be a line (no dimension
in the z axis) and then extrude that into a surface along the xy directions,
then extrude a solid in the z direction and subtract the object from the
solid.  The other half of the mold is created from extruding in the -z
direction.  It needs to be a line because there can't be any gaps between
the z and -z parts.

Yes, I was afraid that that is what you needed.

You can change the radius of the middle sphere to a different number from
the start and end spheres to be more representative.  (see below)

The object I ultimately want to mold is from an .stl file not simple
geometric shapes.  If you created a cube around the .stl, subtract the .stl
from the cube, and then split the cube in two along the parting line that
would be my solution.

---Code---
module shape(){
     hull() {
       sphere(10);
       translate([15,0,10]) sphere(5);
     }
     hull() {
       translate([15,0,10]) sphere(5);
       translate([45,0,0]) sphere(10);
     }
 }

Group() appears in .csg files generated by OpenSCAD. It is accepted as input
from .scad files and appears to be an alias for union().
Is this true or does it also have some hidden function?

A group is a data structure consisting of a sequence of zero or more items,
where each item is either a shape or a group. There isn't much reason to
use the 'group' keyword directly, so the feature isn't documented.

Here's a refinement using children.
Still only generates a thin shell object.
Aals the morphology operators only work on 2D shapes . Else coudl outset the
resulting shell and difference it with a cube.
I've highlighted the cube mod and used inset so it works on arbitrary stl
files.

eps=0.01;
use<scad-utils/morphology.scad>; 

// sample shape
module shape()  {
	hull() {
		sphere(10);
		translate([15,0,10]) sphere(10);
	}
	hull() {
		translate([15,0,10]) sphere(10);
		translate([45,0,0]) sphere(10);
	}
}
 
// Generate parting line object
module parting_1() {
	// Call with a child object of any kind
	scale([2+eps,2+eps,1])color("red")
	intersection(){
		// move object below origin
		translate([0,0,-50])
		linear_extrude(convexity=6)
			// create a thin border line (flat at origin)
			#difference(){
				square(size=[200,100], center=true);
				inset(d=eps)
				projection()
					children(0);
			}
		// intersect with shape
		children(0);
	}
}

//
parting_1() shape();

Ideally the projection() function would somehow make a polygon list
available.
Then if we could test if intersection() of a point, projected along Z, hit
an object and the resulting XYZ location we could then construct a
polyhedron from resulting list of intersection points.
This could then be further adjusted using existing tools to make a two part
mold.

any chance of thi skind of interaction in OpenSCAD2 ?

@runsun thanks I'll have a go at that.
Should work providing the assumption is made that the segments are all
approx the same length (in curviest curve).

@PeterFalke Yes several possible ways of making this specific object but
this object is arbitrary example and the initial question is about sampling
of curves with wildly different samples of knots and how to connect (perhaps
using chain hull) them to create surfaces that behave well.
Good point though. Thanks.

...again we come to the dichotomy of OpenSCAD; currently OpenSCAD is a
geometry generator as a descriptive language, lately people want to make it
an iterative geometry processor, other languages do that.

(yes I have asked for stuff like bounding box in the past...)

Message-ID: <1441681113987-13744.post@n5.nabble.com>

yes - indeed.
However my point is to not go as far as that but to see if we can do this
kind of op with a sensible set of useful operations within OpenSCAD.
I.e. is there a way to use the core to construct (which I feel is
reasonable) a negative mold of a complex part.

My suggestion is to facilitate this within the design of OpenSCAD, not to
turn it into a more complex programming lang.

E.g.
- we have list complerehensions and we can construct polys from lists and
polyhedrons from lists.
- we should also (IMHO) be able to get a list back from a projection() so we
can use it in a list comprehension to further adjust it...
- I agree BBOX() is another super useful thing for exact same reasons.
  - potentially a query like bbox(modulename) would fit into the language
(the geometry from the module being discarded from the CSG tree.

So:
 - bbox(modulename); could return a list of min,max XYZ triplets.
 - 2D(projection(modulename)); could return a nested polygon list. I.e.
points and paths.
 - hit_test(object1, object2); could return a true or false depending on the
existance of an intersected result. or better an XYZ triplet of center of
bbox of the intersected objects.
In all three cases any resulting geometry would be discarded (or hidden(*)
so caches would be kept) from the final tree.

In this way there is minimal adjustment to how OpenSCAD currently works.

You might like to try the Hack code font, in my opinion it works well with
the QScintilla Editor in OpenSCAD.

If you want to try it:
1) Downloaded the font files from GitHub:
https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack.
2) Install the font files (under Windows just double click the font files
and select install).
3) In OpenSCAD select the font: Edit -> Preferences -> Editor (tab) -> Font
(list): Hack
4) Enjoy or uninstall!

I have recently had the need to 3D print Cam's and I thought that other
people might have the same need. I wrote two methods really quickly to make
this possible:

So i am checking this X3D format controversy. So far it's fascinating.
Attempting to save a cube file with different colors on different faces, at
first glance it would be very easy to make an X3D file parser that saves
suitable files from .scad renders:

The X3D header and footer definition code can be only 4-5 lines:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE X3D PUBLIC
&quot;http://www.web3d.org/specifications/x3d-3.3.dtd&quot; &quot;&quot;>
<X3D>
<Scene>
<Shape>
                 //some vertex and color arrays, see example1.x3d
example1.x3d <http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13748/example1.x3d>  
</Shape>
</Scene>
</X3D>

color by vertex has to be set to false and there has to be a colorIndex
array, perhaps there has to be multiple materials in the X3D it said. 

If you have Blender, you can make a color cube and save as X3D as an example
file, and then copy the beginning and end text into an x3d parsing routing
and write the arrays differently. I don't have blender i would be happy if
someone sends a multi material x3d file. 

Afterwards, I found out what X3D is all about. it /can/ save concise 3d
files, and it can also display 3d files in crazy ways in smartphones and web
browsers. 

It's an amazing file format, it can contain alot of lighting and scene
information and even do some kinds of extrusion of pentagons and stuff... 

I found this amazing page with examples, i am  going to attempt to turn this
into a colored cube
<http://examples.x3dom.org/example/x3dom_twoSidedMaterial.html>  and then i
can write x3d parsing program. i write very simple code so anything i do
with triangle indices post processing of an STL should be easy to port to
openSCAD. 

>From this page of examples <http://examples.x3dom.org/simpleExamples.html> 
i found  this
<http://examples.x3dom.org/example/x3dom_multiIndex-large.xhtml>   and  this
<http://examples.x3dom.org/example/x3dom_vertCols.xhtml>  ... Amazing file
format. It is equivalent to VRML2 for our 3d kinds of files, they are both
fine formats.

Ok the name X3D is boring, so i will just have to put on my 3dkini and play
some netbool :D

I figure that CGAL splits the mesh every N vertices or so so that it doesnt
have loops with 2000 things to go through, and then it doesnt make
theoretically one-mesh CSG results? If so, i don't know why it would use so
much memory??!? I saved an STL and viewed it in Sketchup and found that it
was made of sub meshes. 

Please say the construction of the STL files from cgal and is there a way to
join them into one set of mesh arrays? is it always one mesh array the STL
file?

Ok, I've got the urge to do some more work on the AutoComplete and ToolTips
file for Notepad++.  I've been adding the new keywords and the ones I'd
missed before.  Also largely expanding the descriptions and adding examples
where I can (too bad it can't embed images or links).  I've also added some
help_... entries that display the keywords in the same categories as the
cheat sheet, with short explanations, and a help_keyword entry that
displays all of the keywords.  The file is now at least 3x the size it was.

I've got a bit more to do, but I'll put that up as a new item on
Thingiverse in a few days.

If you feel like adding more information as the mentioned images / links, it
would be cool if that info still would end up somewhere. This might become very

Not sure what you mean by "sub mesh". An STL file is a flat list of
triangles. Whether they form one valid mesh or several or just a mess
depends on the numerical values of the vertices.

In general with OpenScad you get a closed mesh for each non overlapping
object. E.g if you make two cubes the STL file will have a single list of
triangles that form two separated meshes.

I don't think CGAL has any optimization for making such operations faster.
CGAL likes to store everything in one huge object, and, due to the nature of
their data structures, they tend to use a lot of memory, as well as CPU
time.

Not sure if that helped - your questions was a bit hard to understand.

Thanks, I can confirm that it seems to be written to one STL array. I was
processing some opescads indifferent programs and some programs devide the
mesh into subgroups at 65534 vertices, for example i had a scad in sketchup
that was in one group devided into 5-7 sketchup components, so i was curious
if the original STL files were some kind of composite array mesh file. i.e.
x3d files i have been seeing recently have objects as multiple shapes in a
scene, and wavefront typs formats probably have just one mesh per file.

Ok i have written an X3D color per face parsing code. It writes color X3D and
i don't have the original colored vertex array from openscad so i can't
color my model as originally intentioned... I have tried instead to color it
by angle of the faces of the elements.

I just worked for 1 hour to understand why there is a difference in the
angles of the normals of triangles that are at the same angle, what
invisible mesh particularity is making my code bug slightly. So my
coloration results are not practical for the moment, i would nearly prefer
to code it directly into openSCAD for a solution. The x3d Export code i have
coded was very straightforwards and saves the files fine every time. All
that is missing is to compare the colors of the input mesh and write them to
the output mesh. 

1> i dont know what language OpenSCAD is written in
2> i dont know how private/static/reserved/next to window/void functions
work
3> i don't know what variables to save the input array to, for later
comparison to the output mesh, perhaps i should write it to a .txt file and

4> Perhaps someone could supply me with a coding framework for openscad
where i have access to the input arrays of objects and their colors, and the
output ones, and from there i can write a code that saves a color x3d file.


  <http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13756/icos_colors.jpg> 

here is the x3d file i can save from an openscad .stl output:
MATRICES24620.x3d <http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13756/MATRICES24620.x3d>

I'd say that's not a huge issue, following the examples of
the other exports is quite good enough to get started.

Actually the whole export part needs some refinement as it
currently has some code duplication due to different internal
data structures.
(e.g. https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/910,
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/909)

I don't understand that part. The current export code simply
writes data directly into a file output stream as it iterates
over the mesh.

See:
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/blob/master/src/export.cc

I'm not sure what coding framework means. Depending on which
Operating System you are working the process differs a bit.
On a recent Linux system, it's probably easiest to follow
the steps from the readme on GitHub as essentially all the
dependencies are available from the distributions.
For Windows, there's a description to set-up a MSYS2 based
development environment in the Manual.
(https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Building_on_Microsoft_Windows)
On MacOS, the dependencies are best compiled separately, I
think, but there are scripts to help with that.

ciao,
  Torsten.

Thanks Torsten, 

I can definitely add an x3d file format output because it is very similar to
.amf output. It's trivial difficulty, if i add x3d to the switch(format)
case list and i add a  export_x3d() function, i figure that x3d would appear
in the /window options list>file>export>format selection list./ Perhaps no
because it is also listed in another file?

So then there would be x3d export, without colors. then things become
difficult. 

So i have seen the cgal website for color, and there is some information
about adding color using a class called
Triangulation_vertex_base_with_info_3 , and there is an example here: 
http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Triangulation_3/#title12
<http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Triangulation_3/#title12>  

And judging from the number of references to color on the cgal website, it's
improbable that a color can be used from the input mesh.

Thanks for the advice for installing a dev environment, i will add x3d
support and at least it will be there if someone knows about the
triangulation_3 class or some other method for writing a color array.

If it were possible to have just the input mesh and the output mesh arrays i
could arrange a color comparison code, and inside the output.cc wouldnt be a
bad place to loop through both meshes and generate a new array for output
colors that could be written to an x3d output file.  

I see *std::ostream &output* and *root_geom* variables, i can see that
ostream somehow results in arrays , i think they arent computed live they
are stored after the CGAL process... and the root_geom would be cool if it
was the input geometry arrays, probably it isn'st.

The menu entry for the GUI would need to be added to the UI description
file (using the QtDesigner)
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/blob/master/src/MainWindow.ui

In case you don't want to dig into that, I guess it would be ok to
just add the part that's used from command line like for AMF:
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/blob/master/src/openscad.cc#L512
We can add the GUI part later.

Yes, the color support will have to wait until the CSG engine
supports that.

There's basically 2 cases of input objects for the export. If the
mesh generation went though CGAL, that produces the CGAL_Nef_polyhedron
(https://github.com/openscad/openscad/blob/master/src/export.cc#L333),
for some cases, e.g. just linear_extrude() of a 2d shape, the input
is a simple (and OpenSCAD specific) PolySet object
(https://github.com/openscad/openscad/blob/master/src/export.cc#L321).
Both contain the whole computed mesh which could contain more than
one volume.

AMF export is currently just lazy and converts PolySet objects also
to CGAL_Nef_polyhedron which is not ideal, but works for now.

To the OpenSCAD developers.

First of all thanks for your amazing work.
In the past August I started modelling  a real delta 3d printer, that I
intend to publish for the community, based on an new idea I had some time
ago. It has been a pain in the ... not because of OpenSCAD of course, debut
because although a have a 6 core processor I do not have a 3D oriented
graphics board. I'm a poor guy... So for the poor guys of this world please
try to help.

My suggestions are:

1 - The scintilla editor should remember on startup the modules, functions,
and instances that were collapsed in the previous session.
2 - Please add a command line to adjust the viewpoint. The lag between the
action of the mouse and the display update drives me crazy.
3 - Automatic backup every time we press ?F5? in order to be possible to
kill the process if we are caught in a loop or extreme delay and not loose
the work, recovering the work from the backup. 
4 - Better than suggestion 3, would be to have a button to stop CSG tree
compilation like the one for CGAL compilation.
5 - Even better than 4 would be the editor to be independent of the
compilation processes. The CSG tree compilation could be done over an
automatically generated backup copy of the actual file with a process
running in background. If ?F5? pressed again the background running process
would be aborted a a new one started. Now I think I'm asking for too much
...

Any help to speed up things to the poor guys of this world is welcome.
Thanks.

re 3.
     FWIW - I get an automatic F5 when I save.
     So instead of doing an F5 I do a ctrl-S.
     This way my file is always up to date (of course you have to manage 
versions on disk).

It would be cool if ever 5 seconds there was a print of the cgal processing
sequence... same as xvid display when it is encoding. 

i.e. vertices processed 897654J 
number of combined primitives - 236 ...

i.e. in a cgal loop which counts vertices into memory, if (i == 1000) echo
the number of vertices and processing stats.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Irregular mesh generated
Message-ID: <1441957527010-13765.post@n5.nabble.com>

My apologies since this is only marginally an OpenSCAD question:

I had the idea of creating more organic objects by algorithmicly generating
models in OpenSCAD and then manually modifying them with Sculptris.   Aside
from the need to convert STL to OBJ (why isnt OBJ exportable BTW?) , the
models tear very easily.  This is probably because the mesh generated by
OpenSCAD contains very irregular triangles. One test case is two spheres
hulled, creating long connecting strips split into two skinny triangles. 

Can anyone suggest a way of remeshing to create a more regular
triangulation.

Chris

That would be nice to have.

However there seems to be no existing hook so it could be done by just
a user of CGAL. Implementing it in CGAL and sending a patch might work
(I don't know anything about their policy of accepting things).

As we don't recompile CGAL on all platforms for release, it could take
quite some time until that feature becomes available.

The plan? hope? wish? is to switch to some alternative library anyway.
Unfortunately that's not an easy topic either...

ciao,
  Torsten.

A powerful CPU (number of cores doesn't matter because CGAL is single-threaded)
goes further than a powerful graphics card for doing OpenSCAD stuff, actually.
I'm on a Core i7 Ivy Bridge machine with integrated graphics and 16GB of RAM.

I use emacs as my external editor and OpenSCAD as merely a viewer. If the F5
frame-rate is too slow, I do F6 instead, which gives me a much better view. If
all else fails, I export it to an stl using the command line (I have Makefiles
for my scad projects, so I can just use my editor's compile function for this)
and use Meshlab to view the part.

I really recommend using an external editor because at least for me, OpenSCAD
hangs while rendering complex objects, and it really drives me nuts to not be
able to do anything while waiting for the render.

TL;DR: An external editor goes a long way to retaining your sanity while using
OpenSCAD.

Hi Kit,
I would suggest loading the stl into Wings3D and then selecting the 
useful faces to subdivide and add more faces/detail that way . Its an 
excellent watertight modeller.
1. Select all Faces, Untriangulate
2. Select a face, Select faces with similar area
3. do a sequence of inset, bevel ops until have desired density.
4. Export

However it can't read the stl variant that openscad writes :(
  - (OpenSCAD can read the watertight stl that Wings3D generates).
So if you wanted to use it you'd have to load it into something else 
first, then export as obj or stl and try another variant of the format.

I imagine Blender works as well... but not as familiar with the polygon 
tools...

If the F5 frame rate gets too low I add render() to the top level objects
to get the speed back. The first F5 takes longer but after that it is
faster as it simply uses the cached CGAL mesh.

Thank you all for the suggestions.
I have an ASUS motherboard M5A78L-M/USB3 with embedded graphics ATI Radeon
HD3000 and 8 GB of RAM. The ram allocated to the graphics is the maximum
that the bios allows, 1 GB. 
Code now is 1.2k lines with 60 modules.

Some thoughts:
 1. What 6 core CPU do you have which doesn't have an integrated GPU? If
it does, and you are not using it, it may be better than the video board
you have.
 2. I use an external editor and tell OpenSCAD to watch a file. Every
time I save the file, it reloads the model. Then you can use whatever
editor you like.

Thanks for the tip.  I've not encountered Wings 3D and its a wonderful tool
and great fun.

However I can't get your suggestion to work on the objects I have in mind
with skinny triangles eg. the Oloid see
http://kitwallace.tumblr.com/post/85636282539/oloid generated by 

module oloid(r,h=0.1) {
   hull() {
     cylinder(r=r,h=h);
     translate([0,pow(2,0.5)*r,0])  // two-point roller
         rotate([0,90,0])
            cylinder(r=r,h=h);
   }
};

$fn=50;
oloid(20);

(actually Wings finds holes in this solid)

Seems to me that inset and bevel just makes even more skinny triangles.

Hi, the biggest problem with my preferred editor Notepad++ (I'm using
windows) is that it do not recognize the opening and closing of curly braces
correctly and do not collapse the entities correctly also. Even with
OpenSCAD extension, that I found on Thingiverse, enabled it doesn't work
well.

I was working on OBJ last year but had some personal challenges that
interfered and I dropped the ball, sorry to all. I think Giles
implemented OBJ export in a branch somewhere. Alternative meshing is
possible but non trivial. Do you have a triangulation algorithm that you
have in mind that you would prefer? And how would the UI work? A
check-mark button that is displayed when the user clicks export?

Hi Kit,
I made on at 30 and tried smoothing it. bit wobbly.
Then I made at 50 and simply selected all the edges and cut into 10 then
connected them.
Worked pretty well but there are two extra edges in there. Perhpas the
mechanism you used to get it into wings3D somehow made a bad object but my
mechanism worked just fine. (no one can afford my mechanism).
So here's two images and I have a model for you if you'd like..
ping me by email if you want it. Its 125kB

Since the points can be obtained through function, it is possible to make
more points along the hull lines. In the following figure, a hull line, PQ,
which we already know the coordinates, are divided into multiple segments:

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13779/Oloid_20150912_KitWallace.png> 

Here are the two functions I use to create those segment points:

*
> onlinePt
*
>  ( pq, len=undef, ratio=0.5 )=
> (
>     let( pq = [pq[0],pq[1]]

> 	):
> 	( len(ratios)==0?[]
>       : [for(r=ratios) onlinePt(pq,ratio=r)]
> 	)
> );

The 1st ( *onlinePt* ) creates a single pt between PQ, the 2nd ( *onlinePts*
) creates multiple pts. Some required functions are not included, but they
are straightforward and easy to make. 

I use the following to create the above segment pts:

>     onlinePts( [P,Q] ratios=[0:0.1:1] )

Don,  An alternative algorithm which traded  minimal number of triangles for
triangle regularity would be great. Looking at
http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Mesh_3/ it looks the parameter
cell_radius_edge_ratio could control the mash topology as required here. 
Perhaps this and maybe other rendering parameters could be set in
Edit/Preferences/Advanced?

Neon22, Many thanks for your efforts - much appreciated.  My efforts were
less successful than yours, with many unconnected vertices.  I'll ping you
for the file to see how it works in Sculptris.

Runsun , Great idea - that leads to a better way for creating a ruled surface
directly as a polyhedron rather than the clucky hulled cylinders I had been
using.  

In general though I think it would be useful to be able to generate meshes
with a topology and format compatible with other tools such as Sculptris and
Wings.

@timHawkins
I just tried assimp.
Regrettably it took every polygon in the stl file and saved it as an obj
with no shared vertices at all.
So for our purposes - this is not a useful library for conversion.

It may be useful to export to obj but would need eval for that.
Not sure where the error lies - in the obj writer or the stl reader, or the
internal representation of objects.

For Wave 3D I just need to convert the STL to binary and assimp does this OK. 
Doesn't help with Sculptris however..  It would be really good to add OBJ
format export (and Binary STL?)  to OpenSCAD. Sounds like its nearly done
anyway?

Hi all,

To summarize a bit:
o Our OBJ export issue: https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/351
o Binary STL would make sense. This issue needs to be addressed: https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/649
o Looks like Wings3D only supports binary STL. They should really improve the importer since most people tend to use ascii STL.
o Having a meshing option which guarantees some sane triangle aspect ratio would be really good. The challenge is dealing with small/null triangles, so we might have to combine this with some sort of decimation algorithm to merge redundant small triangles.

Btw., we have the same issue when creating twisted linear extrusions, but with a much worse effect on the geometry.

When 3D printing you want the least triangles that tessellate the vertices.
Extra ones cause more line segments in the slice and some slicers pass
those on to gcode.

Hi,
I will publish my files only after building the first prototype and it
proves well. Maybe within 1 to 2 months. I do not want to do a release that
is a failure.
Thanks anyway.

Sure. It's always better to have features built-in. I'm still hoping that
someday openscad can report coordinates of a shape ...

i.e, line breaks in a multi-line string is ignored. Is it possible to get
openscad to recognize them ?

Yes it's really a nice thing to get started. There was some initial
post some time ago (http://forum.openscad.org/OpenSCAD-td9598.html)
but unfortunately no more contact I'm aware of.

I think they are still using OpenJSCAD so maybe the plan to switch
to OpenSCAD was dropped or is not finished.

Good thing is that it says it GPL3, and there's a repo on github
(https://github.com/EinsteinsWorkshop/BlocksCAD).

ciao,
  Torsten.

Possible yes, but I'm not sure it's a good idea. With the line
separator having at least 3 variations across platforms, that
could result in unexpected results depending on how the file
was saved.
Actually I'd rather consider that behavior for multi-line strings
a bug ;-). How are other scripting languages coping with that?
At least with bash, the string length differs when changing the
file format.

ciao,
  Torsten.

The (not yet finished) work on 3D mouse support also made it possible to
support also other ways of controlling the viewport. I've added a simple
DBus interface too which allows remote control. This will be only available
for Linux though. I have no idea if there are sensible options for the
other platforms.

This is already there. Every time you compile a modified file, a backup
is made and that's mentioned as first line in the console window.
(e.g. "Saved backup file: /home/.local/share/OpenSCAD/backups/unsaved-backup-MTJ13858.scad")

The biggest improvements can usually be obtained by changing the code
to work around complexity issues for both graphics rendering (F5) and
mesh generation (F6).
Of cause it would be ideal if that would not be needed, but even with
all potential improvements to OpenSCAD, I suspect for very complex models
that will alway be the case.

ciao,
  Torsten.

That's very cool :)

They also implemented color in the rendered output. Meshlab would not load
the X3D file, said it was "not valid", looks ok as text. AMF looks ok.

Now, if we could port their code into OpenSCAD, that would be great. Quite a
fair chunk of Javascript there.

Hi,

I couldn't find a solution to my problem, perhaps the community can help:

after update to the latest version of Openscad on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS I can not
read or even identify anything in the editing dialogue. 

Currently I'm running 2014.29 now and all is fine, any later version and it
all looks like Thai writing.

Please: perhaps you know how to adjust the screen font or how to sort the
problem itself ?

Cheers
Peter

Oh fun! In the readme file it sais the darpa funded it, and they are
searching for more funds to develop it further. i tried some cubes joined
together and it only render one corrupt cube in the preview an in the render
stl file, the x3d crashes meshlab and netfabb. The csg code is csg.js it
runs from index.html if you dl it to the pc. It is fraught with errors. They
should change all the CSG engine to OpenJSCAD. i have more chance of getting
openjscad to run color files. i have a x3d parser already in JS will see if
i can find some colors options in the file formats.

In python we can do:

Yes, actually any menu/toolbar action is available too as the button

to add parameters (e.g. for the export actions).

That's strange, I think the font selection of Qt is also using the
fontconfig library which tries to provide a system wide configuration
for fonts. Maybe there's an issue with the font cache.

You could try editing the configuration file directly. It's stored
at $HOME/.config/OpenSCAD/OpenSCAD.conf

Changing/Adding the fontfamily line in the editor section:

-snip---------------------------------------------
[editor]
fontfamily=Liberation Mono
-snap---------------------------------------------

If that font is not available, the command fc-list should give
a list of all known fonts like:

/.../LiberationMono-Regular.ttf: Liberation Mono:style=Regular


Note that Ubuntu 14.04 has a broken version number, it claims
to be 2014.01.29 but is in reality 2013.01.


ciao,
  Torsten.

The line separator has 2 variations: \n on Macintosh, Linux, BSD, and \r\n
on Windows.

So change the lexer to ignore \r but preserve \n when scanning a string
literal, and the results will be platform independent.

While newer MacOS does use \n, I would not be surprised to still
find the old \r separator in some cases.

Anyway, I guess the main question is if it should be changed or
not. The risk breaking existing scripts is probably not too
high.

Normalizing to always use \n makes sense and might even be
already done by the QTextStream used in GUI mode, not sure
about command line mode though.

There are systems that just use \r.

Just convert the files in format while moving them between systems.

Not any more, and not for a long time. Apple dropped support for Mac OS 9
in 2002, and OpenSCAD seems to have started in 2009. Xt has also never
supported MacOS 9. You've never been able to create a text file with \r
line separators on any system that supports OpenSCAD, and those systems
likely only exist in computer museums nowadays.

i couldn't find a way to copy the code, so I could place it into openscad.

Saving to xml, was simply not an option, just plain unreadable.

But otherwise, a good way to teach kids, and the very old.

Less than a month ago, I got an example data file from a company that
was using \r as a line separator. I don't know for sure where they got
it. (Of course a quick one-liner converted it to something reasonable
for me.)

Until that time, I believed that you were correct. Now, I'm not sure I
would discount Alan's comment so quickly.

Well, it turns out that \r line termination was also used by a number of
popular 8 bit operating systems during the 1980s, including Apple II,
Commodore Pet, TRS-80, and OS-9. And it seems that OS 9 continues to be
used for embedded applications like in-car navigation systems and traffic
light control systems.

But I don't know why we should care about supporting users who are editing
their OpenSCAD source files on Apple IIs or embedded traffic light control
computers.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Polyhedron tube with irregular sides -- is it possible ?
Message-ID: <1442211985023-13813.post@n5.nabble.com>

I wanna make some tube-like shape with irregular sides, similar like one
below:

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13813/20150914_irregular_tube_by_extrude.png> 

This is made with a polygon + linear_extrude out of 

> pts_out =  [ [0,0],[6,0],[6,5],[0,5] ];
> pts_in =  [ [2,1],[5,2], [3,4]];

To make a polyhedron, I convert pts to 3D:


> pts =  [[0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0], [6, 5, 0], [0, 5, 0], [2, 1, 0], [5, 2, 0],
> [3, 4, 0], [0, 0, 3], [6, 0, 3], [6, 5, 3], [0, 5, 3], [2, 1, 3], [5, 2,
> 3], [3, 4, 3]];

Their indices are placed on the extruded shape as follow:

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13813/150914_irregular_tube_marked.png> 

I tried several combinations of faces but couldn't get a polyhedron. Here
are two tries:


>  
> faces1= [[0, 7, 8, 1], [1, 8, 9, 2], [2, 9, 10, 3], [3, 10, 7, 0], [4, 5,

> 9, 10], [11, 12, 13]];
> polyhedron( points = pts, faces = faces1  );

?I guess you need to tesselate the face properly.

Hi Minuti,

I've had some fun playing on Blockscad, it is a very cool idea, my first
steps into programming were using a sound generator visual programming
suite. It's not far off from building 3d using a node editor, I have a
strange visionof a 3d fancyware generator built with lego's of code and with
a synthesizer panel to change parameters. 

Does the program run loops already? The program makes only one cube from a
loop and it seems that openjscad doesn't run loops either. 

Perhaps children would benefit from a small picture in the options menu next
to every 3d command, so sphere, cylinder, to reinforce their understanding
of those, and icons for translate and rotate.

Some examples presets would be cool too, there are some crystals.scad files
around online for girls and some cars and rockets for the boys :) just
because 3 lines of rotations makes so cool crystals icosahedron and
everything.

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13815/synth_program.jpg>  

here is actually a node editor experiment in dx11 environment, 
http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/csg-library-for-c.281028/
<http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/csg-library-for-c.281028/>    can someone
tell me what other visual geometry programming codes exist?

Am I missing something or does the binary maths operator have the connector
in the wrong place? It only seems to connect to an if, rather than
something that expects a value.

In fact I don't think there should be any distinction between if conditions
and values.

Ignoring the \r isn't the way to do it. The logic is trivial to do it
right

  \r\n  -> one newline
else
  \r -> one newline
else
  \n -> one newline
else
  literal character

Given that OpenSCAD is not a programming language, is this an acceptable
term to use in the manual, or is there a better term?

I thought in most projects, the \n did the right thing DEPENDING UPON the
platform it was running on.

So if you are on windows, \n becomes technically a \r\n, on mac and linux,
just \n.

\r shouldn't even be in there, IMO.

Nice, I've accepted the changes.

I'd personally would put the parameter description first and
the various examples after that ;-).

Hmm, the manual says: "...which is based on a Functional
programming language used to create models..." and the
about page "...reads in a script file that describes the
object and renders the 3D model from this script file".

So I guess both "code" and/or "script" are fine as they
are already used in other places.

Maybe move \n to the 2nd condition ?

That was my very first try. But consider that I want a generalized approach,
in which users can punch any shape of hole on a surface of any shape, this
one doesn't seem to be ideal. 

My 2nd try was a function to generate points like this:

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13824/20150914_irregular_tube_paring.png> 

It works, but I imagine that it is still far from the objective of "any
shape". 

So I thought, we can do polygon of any shape with a hole of any shape like
this:

> polygon (points= concate( pts_out,pts_in), faces= [ [0,1,2,3],[4,5,6] ] );
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13824/20150914_irregular_tube_polygon.png> 
 

Shouldn't we be able to use the same way to generate a surface with a hole
in 3D?

So I tried, but it doesn't seem to work. 

Maybe we can implement this feature by allowing faces to have this way:

> [

*

and with this allows for a "punched hole surface" in 3D, thus consistent
with that in 2D ?

The idea is to move more frequently used condition to the top so to reduce
unnecessary checking. 

But, maybe more checkings is better.

Why do you want to exclude using the difference() operation?

Whichever tool you are working with normally handles line endings
correctly for the platform they are on (modulo little issues like
Windows text/binary modes).

The problem comes when you get files from a different system...

Some tools can handle the variations, and we are talking about adding
that feature to OpenSCAD. It isn't really as much of a problem in the
whitespace, but when a newline occur in a string, more thought is
needed.

Just my 0.02.

As far as the order, I think it depends on you perspective. 

For some one with experience, the manual is used as a reference. Your
preferred order is better for this purpose.

For someone new, trying to feel their way around, a different order is
useful.
  The picture best conveys if this is the desired object.
  If so, then example code is the next desire. 
  The parameter descriptions are needed but are the last concern.

Also, when looking at the picture, it is distracting to have the next object
directly under the picture.

Perhaps others can weigh in with their opinion.

It's part of my polyhedron-based lib, in which I'll use the "holed surface"
in different situations, including the irregular-side tube mentioned here.

The manual is a reference IMO.
Much, not all, of the manual is in reference style.

There are lots of how-to's, I don't think that should be the prime role of
this manual.

Unless someone want to create a core, purely syntactic, reference manual
separately.

What we are talking about syntactically is  Line continuation
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages_%28syntax%29#Line_continuation> 
.

The OP wishes the CR character to be a continuation (not a token) when
within the scope of a text string, ie between two string tokens ("), as
default behaviour.

While I have not seen examples of multi-line strings in the wild, I can see
how it would be used with the current behaviour.

string="
a bunch of lines,
a bunch of lines,
a bunch of lines,
\n
a bunch of lines,
a bunch of lines,
a bunch of lines,
\n
a bunch of lines,
a bunch of lines,
a bunch of lines,
\r
";

As such I think the chances of breaking existing code is high.

I think that the OP issue is, probably, more of a problem with command-line
use. Perhaps a run-time flag? 
--stringseperator:[none|preserve|platform|LF|CRLF]

But in summary, I think it is much easier for the operating system/scripts
etc to fix it, than to try to interpret what the intent is.

Finally, given what the following does, I don't think it should be changed.

s1="def\nghi";
s2="jkl\r\nmno";
s3="jkl
\n                                      // comment - actually string text
nmno";

s=s3;
for(i=[0:len(s)-1]) {
	echo(s[i]);
}

polyhedron() cannot do "faces with holes" currently as far as i know. 

However there is a work-around. It is called the Keyhole Polygon... 

Basically you take any polygon with a single hole... and pretend you
slice a knife down from the outside of the polygon, straight down, until
you cut into the hole. What you end up with is a single polygon without
any holes. Here is a picture

https://sozvyezdami.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/11.png?w=640

The caveat that the new edges you create by cutting will be coincident
with each other.... and the 'points' or 'nodes' of those new edges will
also be coincident, which can be a problem for some polygon processing
algorithms. However it appears to work on your basic example in
OpenSCAD. Here is your code rewritten to have two 'keyhole' polygons on
top and bottom. 

pts =  [[0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0], [6, 5, 0], [0, 5, 0], [2, 1, 0], [5, 2,
0],
[3, 4, 0], [0, 0, 3], [6, 0, 3], [6, 5, 3], [0, 5, 3], [2, 1, 3], [5, 2,
3], [3, 4, 3]];

faces1= [[0, 7, 8, 1], [1, 8, 9, 2], [2, 9, 10, 3], [3, 10, 7, 0], 
[4, 5,12, 11], [5, 6, 13, 12], [6, 4, 11, 13], 
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, 4, 3], 
[10, 9, 8, 7, 11, 12, 13, 11, 7]];
polyhedron( points = pts, faces = faces1  );

Also i had to re-order some of the vertices, as viewable in
'View/ThrownTogether' mode within OpenSCAD to make sure there were no
naughty purples. Hope this helps!

Lol.. reminds me of the old saying "Never say never..."  As far as I
understand it, in theory the math model behind CGAL can guarantee "non
broken" geometry... (google for "regularized set operations", very rough
description is that it guarantees that if you start with two water-tight
objects, and perform an operation like union or difference, the result
will be a watertight object, which should propagate through the entire
object tree resulting in a water-tight overall model)

http://www.slideshare.net/hitesh915/presentation7-23624280

http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Nef_3/index.html#sectoinRegularized

But as I understand it, the theory gets a little messed up somewhere in
the thousands of lines of code in CGAL, OpenSCAD, binary floating point
conversion, re-conversion, ASCII decimal floating point conversion,
gcode, etc.

It works very well for me and I'm duly impressed. But you have to manage the
Delta overlaps between volumes when performing any boolean op as adjacency
is indeterminate.

IMHO this is where most people come unstuck making printable objects.

Another reason I love the # operator :) (and Wings3D :))

Python has much larger user space and a lot more fields of application. If
python can handle files from different systems, then this cross-platform
issue shouldn't become a problem for openscad.

Hi Don, interesting approach. I seem to read similar one when reading
Computer Geometry or something a while back, but can't recall what it's for. 

This approach seems to simplify the problem significantly. The
re-arrangement of points is not a big issue. 

On the other hand, for my application, it might bring up other problems.
What I show in this thread is an extremely simplified example. The actual
tube in my lib could be a complicated one with random curving, etc. To make
a holed surface on the end of a long tube with this approach, the entire
tube will have to be sliced apart. 

I also intend to use a holed surface as the merging face when cylinder of
different sides (in polyhedron) linked together. That is, to merge two
polyhedria. It will then be a budding, but not hole-punching/cutting,
process. 

Anyway, thx for the idea. I believe it'd turn out useful in the future
development of my lib.

Really? I thought he was asking for the opposite.

There does seem to be a lot of talking at cross purposes here. What we are
talking about here is specifically how are control characters handled in
quoted strings.

OpenSCAD uses a lexer built with flex. The code for strings looks like this:

\"			{ BEGIN(cond_string); stringcontents.clear(); }
<cond_string>{
\\n			{ stringcontents += '\n'; }
\\t			{ stringcontents += '\t'; }
\\r			{ stringcontents += '\r'; }
\\\\			{ stringcontents += '\\'; }
\\\"			{ stringcontents += '"'; }
{UNICODE}               { parser_error_pos -= strlen(lexertext) - 1;
stringcontents += lexertext; }
\\x[0-7]{H}             { unsigned long i = strtoul(lexertext + 2, NULL,
16); stringcontents += (i == 0 ? ' ' : (unsigned char)(i & 0xff)); }
\\u{H}{4}|\\U{H}{6}     { char buf[8]; to_utf8(lexertext + 2, buf);
stringcontents += buf; }
[^\\\n\"]		{ stringcontents += lexertext; }
\"			{ BEGIN(INITIAL); 
			parserlval.text = strdup(stringcontents.c_str()); 
			return TOK_STRING; }
}

The sequences "\n" and "\r" are de-escaped and added to the string. I can't
figure out where raw CR and LF are handled, but they appear to be ignored?

I did not fully test all the combinations yet, but I think the unquoted \n
is explicitely _not_ handled in

[^\\\n\"] { stringcontents += lexertext; }

hence it's ignored. As I did not get any stray \r in GUI mode when using
DOS file format, so I guess the QTextStream already translates everything
to just \n. Command line might be different as it's not using Qt.

As said before, the main question is not how to implement it, but IF it
should be changed (or just put on the big heap that is wishes for the
OpenSCAD2 language ;-).

ciao,
  Torsten.

I'm not saying it's impossible, or that OpenSCAD shouldn't do it.

The point is that this is actually not an automatic feature of any OS
I'm aware of. OpenSCAD will need to change to handle it explicitly.
That includes making such decisions as how to handle a 'line end
character sequence' when it is inside a double quoted string.

  1. Keep it literal
     - surprise effects when the file is used on another system and the
       string is printed

  2. Convert it to current system's line ending
     - surprise effects when the file is used on another system and we
       depend on the length of the string or the exact character values.

  3. Convert it to a canonical line ending
     - similar issue to 2, above. But at least it's consistent.

All of the decisions are a trade-off. Many tools have followed the 'C'
tradition of treating text line endings as "\n" no matter how they
exist on disk (option 3). That doesn't require a lot of work, but there
is a little bit.

Sorry for ranting a bit. I've had to _solve_ this problem before (for
small values of the term "solve").

Valid point. The next time I edit the page I will rearrange it.

I used the manual for learning because it was what I could find. Where does
one find the how-to's?

You could use the term "markup", I tend to think of openscad as a scripting
language attached to a 3d model format, in a simular way that javascript
interacts with the html DOM.

I see what you mean. 

This thread from the beginning is a feature request, so yes, it means a
change to openscad. 

Like Tosten said, how to is not an issue, but "if we want to do it" is. With
the relatively small discussions (comparing to vast openscad users out
there), I don't see many positive voices. 

But this is somehow expected, after all, handling long or multiline string
is not in most users' mind.

I personally do have the need, but I supposed it's just 0.00001% or less.

Yes,  I am asking CR in a sting to be treated as a line break, but not line
continuation. Openscad ignores CR, so in effect it's the same as handling it
as line continuation already. 

One of the issues I have with it is that the following string, for example :

>     
>  2015.3.3: new arg *Rf* : a point given to decide the sign of

>

> "

is echoed to the console as a long winding line without paragraphs. Even I
have a split(...) function, I can't manage to show the text in console as it
is. 

It'd be worse if I want to doc my code with a figure:

>               N
>           .:'`|`':.
>         :`    |    `:

>           '/._|_.-'`. 
>           /          R
>          P

 
My current solution is to put something in the beginning of line for my
split() function to catch, and I don't want to use \n because it is much
harder to type:
 

>  " Given a 3-pointer (pqr), return the angle of P-Q-R. 
> ;;    
> ;; 2015.3.3: new arg *Rf* : a point given to decide the sign of

> ;;     
> ;; 2015.3.8: 
> ;;    
> ;;  Allows for angle( [line1,line2]). 
> ;;
> "

But it'd be more convinient if openscad can see CR as line break.

Even though OpenSCAD _is_ a turing complete programming language, we?ve tried to sell it as a description language, to reduce the amounts of complaints about feature completeness vs. other languages. Otoh, ?programming language? is a good description when talking to non-professionals.  Rather than having official terms, we could perhaps just call it whatever we feel like depending on context, and do a writeup in the manual explaining the execution model to people who?re interested?

"Markup" means annotations that are added to a text document, which
describe how the text is to be formatted. OpenSCAD is not a markup language.

The word "code" is just fine.

Hi Torsten, i have written a feature request on the CGAL web page, and two
CGAL programmers have already offered solutions in the same day, however the
precise nature of the request is not very clear to explain, perhaps you can
add some wisdom at some time because it is already quite a confusing topic,
check here: https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/issues/341#issuecomment-140415456

Cgal does seem very robust, perhaps that it's speed is also makes it's
strength because it doesnt miss any kinds of multi triangle intersections.
perhaps it's cgal that makes openscad strength, it is slow and very
reliable.

Ahh, nice. Look like Marius already commented on the issue. After
quite some battles with CGAL, he knows it much better than me, so
I guess the topic is in good hands. I've subscribed to the issue,
let's see what happens...

ciao,

Good eye, nophead, True and False are perfectly acceptable numbers! That
should be an easy fix. I think we were trying to avoid "True plus one is
what?" situations, but there's nothing inherently wrong with those. 

ufomorace, both BlocksCAD and OpenJSCAD do loops, the same way as OpenSCAD.
No variable reassignment ('cause that's just silly). Examples are
forthcoming - we've got a lot of cool things we've made. And you might like
Antimony  http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/antimony/3/
<http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/antimony/3/>  . It's node-based,
implicit cad. I can't stand node-anything, personally, but I know a lot of
people think that way. Give me a Makefile and a folder of .scad files any
day :)

jdawgaz, I think you might have missed the "Code" tab in the upper-right.
Going from OpenSCAD to BlocksCAD is planned, but we're still missing some
OpenSCAD features like minkowski, projection, children, and arrays. Once
we've got those, we'll get to work on import.

I just copied/pasted the console text into Notepadd++ (windows) and it
contains CRLF at EOL.

So the console output is still going to be platform dependent.

Unfortunately we don't know how many programs out in the wild use multiline
strings in the current method.

I vote for no change.

That does not happen here. Which version on which OS and how is

Hmm, looks like some platform specific issue then :(, both 2015.03-1 and
the dev version don't have that problem on Linux.

Happens here too.
Often the Console is the focus even after manipulating the 3D view with
mouse, or clicking on the grey space at the top of the editor. You have to
click in the white space to focus the that. Even tho the caret it blinking
there already - which is misleading.

Perhaps the console is created first and becomes the focus, then nothing
changes it to the editor? 
BTW, need to consider what to focus on when the editor pane is hidden.

In other programs i use keyboard orbit, where WASD allow total up down left
right orbital of the display.

with openscad, the keyboard is always attributed to the text area, so the
control for orbit would have to be programatic or a new button on the
display area. in code it's just having access to the camera transform :D and
a time variable.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] What's your opinion on these criticisms of Openscad?
Message-ID: <loom.20150917T180038-810@post.gmane.org>

I am in the process of choosing a CAD software to learn. I find a
review on openscad, and would like to see expert opinions on the following
criticism.
If these are ture, what is the impact on product design?

1 language does not have variables, for example. It has things
which look as if they should be variables, but they are in fact
evaluated statically at compile-time and are really just
constants. There is an "assign" function which can alter values
at run-time, but it does not give the full behavior of a
variable (you cannot use it to pass variable parameters, for
example). It's a bit like one of the (so called) "functional
programming language" beloved of mathematicians, but wrapped in
the syntax of a procedural programming language without even
the (dubious, in my opinion) clarity of a real functional
programming language.

2 Openscad does not really do CSG. It is a front-end for either
of two "rendering" (using the term loosely) libraries: OpenCSG
and GCAL. OpenCSG is a splendidly tricky program which appears to
do CSG without actually ever doing the calculations for the
geometry. As a display engine, OpenCSG is brilliant. But there's
more to CAD than display. GCAL is indeed a library of
computational graphics algorithms which can do the geometry "for
real." But OpenSCAD uses CGAL just to generate
STL (stereolithography) output files. There is no way to get at
the geometry calculated by GCAL within the OpenSCAD model.  He
then gives an example that openscad can't find the intersection
point of 3 planes.

3 OpenSCAD lacks the powerful capabilities of local
coordinate systems.

The link to the review is here
http://www.circuitousroot.com/artifice/drafting/reviewing-the-options/index.html#brl-cad

I think the simple answer is none of those features are necessary to
describe a 3D object, so for those that think logically and understand high
school maths and geometry there are no limits to what you can create with
OpenScad. For people that think visually conventional 3D CAD is probably
better.

It certainly can be done this way --- if it's short and not frequent. 

However, I'm writing a lib that requires users to write documentation of
functions/modules in code for later processing. Having to type \n in every
line will like discouraging users to use it. 

Just imagine the situation when we are writing posts in this forum --- we
simply hit CR for a line break, and 2 CRs for a new paragraph. What if it
requires us to write \n in every line ?

OpenSCAD has immutable values, which doesn?t stop you from doing anything in terms of programming. It just tends to confuse programmers who have only been exposed to procedural languages. Some people call this "iterative programmers disease?.
If you?re confused by functional programming, you can use one of the packages generating OpenSCAD code using other programming languages (python, ruby, C etc.).

> 2 Openscad does not really do CSG.

As opposed to his beliefs, CGAL doesn?t do CSG in the way he thinks either; they just do meshes.
Doing a real NURBS BRep-style CSG engine would be cool though. Still waiting for a good Open Source CAD kernel who can do that :)

OpenSCAD has two ways to create shapes, one is the commonly used primary
shape modules like cube(), cylinder(), etc. The other is polyhedron in which
you can define points of your choice. 

It's true that OpenSCAD doesn't calc something like intersection using the
primary shapes modules, but you can always achieve this with polyhedron. In
my code, I'm doing the intersection all the time, line-line, line-plane,
plane-plane ... etc. I believe it's won't be that difficult to find
intersection of object.

All OpenSCAD shapes start with O=[0,0,0], with the x,y,z in the [1,0,0],
[0,1,0], [0,0,1] directions, resp. That's the only one GLOBAL coordinate
system we have. If we want to make a shape on some point P, we make it on O
first, then move it to P.

A local coordinate system is a coordinate system right on P, such that the
obj can be made directly on P.

This sound redundent if O => P is just a parallel translation. But often
cases are that it requires rotations as well. So in many .scad practices, we
see users in struggle trying to make the rotation/translation right. 

I personally think that this criticism has it's point. In fact, I create my
polyhedron lib entirely in local coordiate system. In my lib, given any 3
points in the space, users can make a shape on that. 

This doesn't mean the OpenSCAD global coordinate system is at fault. In many
many cases, a global system is much quicker and easier to handle, especially
when users want is not complicated, and I believe this is the application
that OpenSCAD is designed for. But if we go beyond some complication level,
a local coordinate system will be very handed.

Say that you create a tall, slender cylinder in OpenScad, one whose height is perhaps 4 times larger than its diameter.  At the time of the cylinder's creation, the global axes and the cylinder's local axes will be identical, with the local z- and global-z axis lying along the longitudinal axis of the cylinder.

Now say that you rotate the cylinder 45 degrees about the global x-axis.  The global x-axis and the cylinder's local x-axis still remain the same after the rotation.  However, the cylinder's local z-axis will rotate along with the cylinder so that it remains aligned with the cylinder's longitudinal axis.  Likewise, the cylinder's local y-axis rotates, too.

You can see why this kind of a feature might be useful (not that I'm arguing for it).  There are some occasions when a designer might want to translate or rotate an object relative the object's local axes rather than the global axes.  For example, if the slender cylinder were a bolt instead, and if the bolt was rotated 45 degrees about the global x-axis, and if you wanted to prepare an animation where the bolt tightens, then you would want to rotate the bolt about its longitudinal axis, which would be its local z-axis.

I suspect that the mathematics for tracking and displaying an object's local axes would be very complex.

In my business (structural engineering) most structural analysis software packages will recognize that each structural member has its own set of local axes, in addition to the global axes that tend to govern for the entire structure.

That review is relatively amusing.

A lot of the complaints are the same ones I've seen in the past from
programmers who only know one language looking at a language they are
unfamiliar with. "See it's not a real language, it doesn't have this
one feature that I like in the form that I like it."<shrug/>

The variables in OpenSCAD could be called "constants" or "immutable
variables". They cannot change over time, because OpenSCAD models a
physical object...time is not a factor.

Note that this is his opinion. Many of us have done functional
programming in more procedural languages for years.

It could be fair to point out that OpenSCAD does not deal with infinite
objects like planes. The 0-dimensional point at the intersection of 2
planes is kind-of outside the scope of a tool for generating 3D models
for fabrication. It's kind of like making the argument that all
programming languages are bad, because they can't properly deal with
infinite precision real numbers.

However, as a practical point, I can easily find the intersection
volume of 3 thin planes.

That's a fair point. I haven't actually needed it in my designs. But, I
could pretty easily simulate it in my modules.

I would have really loved to see his example code, (it seems to be
giving a 404 at the moment). From his description, he seems to be
mistaking his inexperience with the tool for limitations of the tool.

Have a look at some of the (video) tutorials to get an impression of
Openscad:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNghpq9sKRc

http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/OpenScad_beginners_tutorial

(I just googled these, ther are more around.)

All things on http://www.thingiverse.com/ that use the costumiser are using
Openscad, and a lot of other model are made with Openscad, there, as well.

Whenever you use translate and rotate you create a local coordinate system
underneath them in the tree. If you have a cylinder at an arbitrary angle
and position and you want to put say a sphere on top then you simply
translate the sphere by the height of the cylinder at the same tree level
as the cylinder. If that is not convenient code structure wise you make the
translation and rotation into a module that can be used anywhere. Such a
module could be considered a named local coordinate system.

Multiple years of back compatibility

Removal of any ambiguity.

If you are doing general text formatting in ECHO in openscad thats a bit
of an odd use already. Using newlines embedded or explicit won't work in
either case because you've got no idea how wide the window is and the
font in use.

Perhaps you'd be better off submitting a patch to mke the ECHO output
justified ?

Yes users can do that. However, it's not a straightforward thing for people
who do not already master in this process.  OpenSCAD is my first and only
software to learn and use in 3D drawing. It took me a long long time to
write this thing --- about a little more than a year  from knowing nothing
about OpenSCAD to such a module. It's fair to say that this feature is one
of the biggest obstacles in my learning process.  Many people might just
turn away. 

I have the impression that OpenSCAD is developed with a mind that people can
pick it up and use it quickly, even for beginners. With this in mind, I do
believe that a module to move (translate+rotate) an obj from one coordinate
system to another should have been made built-in.

"no idea how wide the window" is a valid point, especially considering that
the console output can be saved to a file and read by a browser, which is
very common now on mobile devices. 

"justified output" is not good enough, 'cos many funcs in my lib use ascii
graph to explain features, which requires specific line breaks. 

It's indeed an odd use. This doctest lib of mine is probably good for lib
writers only. I am making a tool that a lib writer can set a cron job to run
function tests nightly and send notification automatically when something
goes wrong. At the mean time it can produce documentation in html format. 

It's understandable that the majority of openscad users have no need for
this. So I'll have to use the more inconvenient approach. 

So, lets move on. Thanks too all participate in the topic.

cube( [100, 100, 1] );
cube( [100, 1, 100] );
cube( [1, 100, 100] );

This would give three 100mm x 100mm plates 1mm thick.
You could replace the 1 with an arbitrarily small number, of course.
But, too much smaller and it would not be useful for printing.

Message-ID: <1442530243137-13883.post@n5.nabble.com>

In regard to the OP.

If you are from a programming background, and can understand the difference
between an iterative language and a functional language (even if you haven't
used the later), you will be able to learn to program functionally. You will
likely like OpenSCAD.

If you like to use your mouse to grab a cube and drag it, then OpenSCAD is
not for you.

In reality OpenSCAD is a descriptive geometry language, conceptually like
HTML, you define the layout. It basically builds a tree of geometry, not a
sequence of iterative statements. Once you understand the distinction, which
can take a mind-shift, it becomes easy.

Re OP items

1. 

- "(you cannot use it to pass variable parameters, for example)." wrong.
OpenSCAD is fully parametric, if you want it to be. 

- there have also been a number of advances since 2014. 
-- full recursion with concat() means the language is  Turing Complete
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness>  .
--  List Comprehensions
<https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/List_Comprehensions>  ,
allow you to use variables in new ways.

2. 

- well it produces CSG geometry, he is correct in that you cannot get the
numeric result of a CSG operation and then use that to modify other
geometry, that breaks the descriptive/functional programming language
context. 
-- what that means is you need to calculate the point you are interested in
and then describe the geometry in that context. 
-- probably one of the more frustrating aspects for complex models, and has
lead to a number of proposals for change, which generally have not gone
anywhere, because they break the language context. Although there are some
workarounds which may become available (called OpenSCAD2 - although I may be
wrong - early days)

- OpenCSG and GCAL. What he misses about this is the usability aspect.
OpenCSG is quick, GCAL is Slooow. With OpenSCAD this gives you a quick
preview of your design, without the overhead of fully calculating the
geometry of every point. When you are ready, or need to, you can render the
full model. This combination is IMO what makes OpenSCAD stand out.

3. See discussion in above posts. Not a problem AFAIC.

Other points.

In his review, he talks about a .scad script to make the tool, unfortunately
it is not available. I suspect it could have been done in a better/easier
way using OpenSCAD as it is designed for. He is coming from a position of 'I
need to get the CSG result, but can't, so I did it this way as a hack'.

Finally, he has not looked into support. Have a look around the forum and
Github repository, you will find OpenSCAD is one of the best  supported
products, both by developers, and the community. Unlike Varkon it would
seem.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] What's your opinion on these criticisms of Openscad?

1. quote: "because OpenSCAD does not have variables it is not possible to
pass anything other than compile-time constants as parameters to modules."

This isn't correct. OpenSCAD variables are run-time constants, not compile
time constants, and that makes a big difference.

OpenSCAD is a purely declarative (aka functional) language. That's a
feature, not a bug. You describe geometric objects using pure mathematics,
which has a number of advantages. The only disadvantage is that this style
of programming uses different idioms than what you might be used to from
Python or Javascript. If you have some experience with the functional style
of programming, or if your mind hasn't been corrupted from years of
programming in an imperative language, then OpenSCAD is straighforward.

2.  "Openscad does not really do CSG."

Actually, OpenSCAD really does do CSG. Check out the definition of CSG in
Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry.

First, the fundamental geometric object in OpenSCAD is a geometric solid.
Second, all of the fundamental CSG operations are supported, as well as
some additional advanced operations, like convex hull and minkowski sum,
which are missing from BRL-CAD.

"There is no way to get at the geometry calculated by GCAL within the
OpenSCAD model." Yes, this is a known limitation: there are some open
feature requests to fix this. OpenSCAD is actively maintained and
continually improving, so this may be fixed in a future release.

It turns out that BRL-CAD has some features missing from OpenSCAD. As I
have noted, the reverse is also true. The conclusion that "OpenSCAD is not
a true CSG system" is completely false, though. OpenSCAD users have a
somewhat different set of idioms for describing geometry than BRL-CAD
users. Different doesn't automatically mean worse.

3. "OpenSCAD also lacks the powerful capabilities of local coordinate
systems present in Varkon. (In fairness, most CAD programs lack this as
well.)"

Varkon is an imperative programming language; programs are written in a
completely different style from OpenSCAD. In Varkon, all geometry is
created using side effects. At first glance, this aspect of the language
looks pretty horrible to me, compared to what I'm used to in OpenSCAD.
Local coordinate systems are a kludge to work around some of the
limitations of this style of programming, since I assume you can't modify a
geometric object once it has been emitted, and I don't think they are
needed in OpenSCAD.

In Varkon, you apparently call "mode_local" to enter a local coordinate
system, then you call a module, which outputs a set of geometric objects as
a side effect, modified by the current local coordinate system. At least
that's what I think is going on. In OpenSCAD, a module call is a
side-effect-free expression that returns a geometric object, which you can
then modify by applying transformations like translate and rotate. That's
what you do *instead of* using local coordinate systems. I like the
OpenSCAD approach better.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] showing vector within vector in user manual
Message-ID: <1442593284399-13885.post@n5.nabble.com>

I am plying in my sandbox, trying to add a polygon example without a hole to
the user manual.

It works fine in OpenSCAD, but whenI try to show it with WikiBooks I run
into a problem.

when I try to show:
   polygon(points=[[0,0],[100,0],[130,50],[30,50]], paths=[[0,1,2,3]]);
the result is this:
   polygon(points=[[0,0],[100,0],[130,50],[30,50]], paths=0,1,2,3);

The following all display what is specified:
   a=[[0,0],[100,0],[130,50],[30,50]];
   b=[[0,1,2,3],[]];
   b=[0,1,2,3];

but this, which is the correct syntax:
   b=[[0,1,2,3]];
shows this:
   b=0,1,2,3;

where the brackets are removed and the numbers highlighted in red.

That's because [[ is wiki markup.

Looking at https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting the following
might work:

  <nowiki>b=[[0,1,2,3]];</nowiki>

So you've got \n for those. Although given there is no guarantee that the
font is fixed width its already a lost cause for charts

Console output could be controlled with html. You simply wrap the string
with monospace font family and it works nicely. 

I design it to output both in the console and to a html file. So I need html
markup anyway. 

Here are two examples. Copy and paste it to the editor then get a preview,
it will look the same in both the editor and the console, regardless what
font the user has in the preference ( other than \n, and assuming that all
programmers use monospaing font to code ):

So my only complaint is the \n, which I believe it will discurage users from
using my lib.

There seems to be no problem to go to the code panel, highlight all, hit
ctrl-c and paste it to openscad using Firefox.

If your issue is purely related to echo() output, there may be other options
than globally changing string behaviour.

Could you post the .scad code (not the lib) that you had to enter to create
that picture.

list1 = [ for (i = [0 : 2 : 10]) i ];

It's all about echo() output, to my knowledge it's the only way users can
check if openscad recognizes \n.

You are looking at the source code.

There is a bug.

Edit the library, near the bottom in module egg() change the cube() to
square().

Also prob. good to comment out the test just below.

Looks like two bugs in the egg module -- it uses cube instead of square.

Message-ID: <1442673528944-13900.post@n5.nabble.com>

I love it when a geometry library has options like rotate towards, Vector3 to
euler angles, Distance, lerp, and similar options. Is there any chance you
could add these functions or an openscad file because they are not easy to
code them to openscad, it's would be awesome to find a heavy geom functions
library and just copy it into openscad engine:

Vector3 modules
Angle	 Returns the angle in degrees between from and to.
ClampMagnitude 	Returns a copy of vector with its magnitude clamped to
maxLength.
Cross	Cross Product of two vectors.
Distance	Returns the distance between a and b.
Dot	Dot Product of two vectors.
Lerp	Linearly interpolates between two vectors.
LerpUnclamped	Linearly interpolates between two vectors.
Max	Returns a vector that is made from the largest components of two
vectors.
Min	Returns a vector that is made from the smallest components of two
vectors.
MoveTowards	Moves a point current in a straight line towards a target point.
Normalize	
OrthoNormalize	Makes vectors normalized and orthogonal to each other.
Project	Projects a vector onto another vector.
ProjectOnPlane	Projects a vector onto a plane defined by a normal orthogonal
to the plane.
Reflect	Reflects a vector off the plane defined by a normal.
RotateTowards	Rotates a vector current towards target.
Scale	Multiplies two vectors component-wise.
Slerp	Spherically interpolates between two vectors.
SlerpUnclamped	Spherically interpolates between two vectors.
SmoothDamp	Gradually changes a vector towards a desired goal over time.

A couple of the basics are there - https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#Mathematical_Operators <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#Mathematical_Operators>

- Dot-product is implicit when multiplying (the ?*? operation) two vectors of equal length.

https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#Vector_Dot-Product_Operator <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#Vector_Dot-Product_Operator>

- Use the cross(v1,v2) function for cross-product of two vectors.

https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#cross <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#cross>

I had included matrix inverse operation from the eigen library in my first attempt at including matrix operation support in OpenSCAD, but that got lost thru the major Value rewrite/re-architecting that happened a couple of years ago.

What about starting with some of the easier functions, putting
those in a file on github (or similar service) and then start
discussing how to go from there step by step?
Note that if the target would be to include it into OpenSCAD
distribution (which would be awesome), the license should be
clarified from the start.

When the question is "could someone please write a huge complicated
library I'd like to use" the number of people who identify with
"someone" is usually not very high.

ciao,
  Torsten.

I've been working on a lib that can do a lot of what you describe, but it is
not ready for release yet  :( 

I'm gonna make some remark going through your list:

Thanks runsun, i will attempt that. cool libs runsun, if i was not confused
at this moment i would have a change to figure them out in the near future.
!!! nice!!! The kit wallace codes are very sound i hope i will have them to
make some fish and chips in 3d for my city coding project.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] graphics card speed in openSCAD
Message-ID: <1442680656388-13909.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi, i have noticed that sometimes my graphics card it going at 2 FPS when
displaying an assembly of 500 cubes inside 2-3 unions-differences. My
graphics card can display 16trillion vertices per nanosecond and and has
liquid nitrogen heatsink assembly. What is the speed because? Is the program
sending a giant raft of data to the graphics card on every frame? What is
the bottleneck due to? what are the codes in openscad that communicate with
the graphics card? is it DX or GL based? 

Please tell me where are the library functions that regulate the graphics
card vertices and array inputs? Is the entire coordinate system sent to the
graphics card and rotated? where is the camera object in the openscad code?
is it moving around the object?

Hi Torsten,

Did you get the OP as an email from the list? As I didn't, nor any of his
other posts, so something is off.
If you did get an email could you forward it to me so I can check out its
headers etc.

Thanks,
Michael

All of ufomorace's emails go into my spam folder, despite me continually
marking them as not spam. Google doesn't like his email address.

Uh, wait, it's not Nabble it's received from.

The path for the forum post is

1) Original Post nabble.com (forum)
2) Mail server nabble.com
3) emwd.com (mailing list)
4) Receiver (gmx.de in my case)

Just using the mailing list it's different as Nabble
is not in the path, only emwd.com.

ciao,
  Torsten.

Have you checked your spam folder? I get all of his emails, so they get
sent OK from the mailing list. I just have to dig them out of my spam.

Yeh, as Nophead said, they were in my gmail spam folder. Trouble is I have that account forwarded,
so I don't see the spam unless I go looking.

It said that his yahoo address did not pass the yahoo checks (called from gmail).

ufomorace - you may want to check you yahoo mail account.

Lots of people on the mailing list use gmail and your posts get sent to spam.

Hi there, Thanks Torsten i'll have to learn some new graphics concepts. it is
a very complex renderer.

For my email, here is what happened. I subscribed 4 months ago to as a
single question and i wasn't familiar with the software. I took the
individual messaging by mistake and i recieved 50 emails that were about
development that i didn't grasp. I thought it would be ok to put the mail to
the spam folder for the time being until i could find the unsub buttons, and
the mail at the time was fine on subscription. I figured out the program and
had to be on the list again and i subbed again except that my email isnt
recognized.

Sorry about that. It's difficult to keep things tidy on the  pc. :\

At least the F6 result rendering is pretty easy, I don't know
enough about the preview stuff (that is how OpenCSG works in
detail) yet to judge that part.

I wrote a simple 3d mesh viewer to learn about how to use the
more modern OpenGL stuff, especially putting all data directly
into the graphics card and using shaders to display the mesh
(https://github.com/t-paul/3dview/).
The ideal solution would be to use some library to make it
even easier. I still did not manage to find the time to have
a closer look at Magnum (http://mosra.cz/blog/index-en.php)
but that seems like a nice option and the main developer is
also very active and helpful.

My impression is that the biggest part in improving the OpenSCAD
rendering code is to do it in a way that works on all platforms.
There seem to be still lots of systems that are not capable of
using modern OpenGL (mainly due to missing/obsolete graphics
drivers).

ciao,
  Torsten.

Right, that makes sense. If I post on the forum, I'm even getting
an error message from the mailing list as Nabble is trying to post
using my gmx.de address. As GMX is using SPF the mailing list
correctly rejects the mail as it's not coming from a listed server.

Looks like gmail is using similar information for spam detection.

ciao,
  Torsten.

The simplest of commands for one file would be:

   openscad -o file.stl file.scad

You could repeat this using whatever looping construct is available in
your shell. (For windows, it's been so long I can't remember the
syntax.) For bash, you could do

for f in *.scad; do openscad -o ${f/scad/stl} $f; done

Personally, I use a Makefile with an appropriate rule for converting
any .scad file into a .stl.

%.stl: %.scad
	$(OPENSCAD) -o $@ $<

Very chuffed that you both find my stuff helpful.  

I've updated the polyhedral code to remove assign.  That Small Stellated 
Dodecahedron looks horrible!  I've a new version which works on polyhedral
forms in user space without CSG operations and supports Conway operations
that I'll put up RSN.

runsun,  I'm looking forward to your new libraries so I can do even more on
polyhedra, particularly to see if I can do crystal stuff using Miller
indexes in user space

Hi,

I'm rendering chains, and if i scale them up to more ( and identical to the

Any hints ?

I had need to basically slice apart my frame that I was making.
I wanted to create as much surface area as possible for the pvc glue to
take hold.

So Instead of just creating 2 cubes to glue together I made a set of
dovetail cubes.

I figured that any way that gets the job done is a good way (like any
landing you walk away from is a good landing sort of thing).

But, since I have not been doing this too long. And am only part time at
it, I would ask if there was a better way I could have done what I did, or
would most people have done something similar?

Anyway, here is the code:

// dovetail cubes: a male that fits into a female

// in the following two modules:
//   w = width of cubes
//   l = the length of the cubes
//   t = the thickness

module malecube(w=4, l=5, t=1) {
translate([0,0,-l/2]) cube([t,w,l], center=true);
translate([-t*0.5,w/2,0]) rotate([90,0,0]) linear_extrude(height=w)
  polygon(
    points=[[0,0],[t*0.5,t*0.5],[t,0]]
  );
}


module femalecube(w=4, l=5, t=1) {
    difference() {
        cube([t,w,l], center=true);
        translate([-t/2,w/2+0.1,-l/2-0.01])
          rotate([90,0,0]) linear_extrude(height=w+0.2)
            polygon(
              points=[[0,0],[t*0.5,t*0.5],[t,0]]
            );
    }
}

// tests:
//translate([0,0,0]) femalecube(14, 14, 6);
//translate([0,0,-15]) malecube(14, 10, 6);

Looks OK to me - lots of ways to skin a cat (what an awful expression!) with
Openscad.

I'd be tempted to remove redundancy by defining the female in terms of the
male e.g

module femalecube(w,l,t) {
 difference() {
    translate([0,0,l/2]) cube([t,w,l],center=true);
    malecube(w,l,t);
  }
}

Just checked info about Miller Index. Cool thing. A very good way to describe
plane, which could be very useful.

One item on my to-do list is to build a chemistry.scad lib. In fact, it's
already easy for my lib to generate, for example, a benzene molecule --- the
first 3 lines to generate points, the next 2 to display:

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13933/29150920_bezene.png> 

which is made with 5 lines of code:

>    pqr=pqr();    
>    pts = circlePts( pqr, n=6,rad=3);
>    ringPts = circlePts( pqr, n=48,rad=1.8); 
>    
>    MarkPts( pts, ["r=0.5;color=black",
> "chain",["closed",true,"nside",24,"color",undef,"r",0.2] ] );
>    MarkPts( ringPts, ["ball=0",
> "chain",["closed",true,"nside",24,"color",undef,"r",0.2] ] );

I can picture this to be a very good tool for chemistry education. Lets talk
more about the Miller Index once my lib is ready.

I thought it would be a call to a library module with other parameters etc.
Anyway...

What you are after is a  heredoc
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document>  ,   as used in many languages
<http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Here_document>  

n possibilities which don't break existing strings;

a. Introduce a new string type using single quote ('), ie 

var='this
string
includes
line
breaks';  

Need to decide if it is fixed as LF only, or platform dependent LF or CRLF,
I'd propose the former.


b. Introduce a string prefix flag, possibly a kludge, but could be useful
for other things, particularly comment;

var=<some prefix characters>"this
could
be
multi-line              // possibly with comments depending on the prefix
depending
on
the
prefix";

Possible prefix types; (off the top of my head)
R - raw (uses LF) possibly ignores escapes (\n etc), 
C - treat // as comments
I  - discard indented whitespace (with C also looses whitespace in front of
//)
etc.

Not sure how simple that would be in terms of parsers.


c. Use the popular triple quote multi-line syntax;

var="""
anything
here

""";

need to consider \" escapes, prob. best as per normal strings?
also whether leading whitespace is allowed on the closing triple quote (for
code indentation)

d. The popular <<delimiter;

var=<<EOF
This is
one way
EOF;

Need to consider the semi-colon position here?? Also leading white space on
EOF


e. Or any other specific from the Rosetta link above, like the C++ one
maybe.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

String processing in OpenSCAD is now a growing aspect.
If we are to introduce such a change, you could also include variable
substitution in strings.

expletive="bloody";
var=R"EOF(
This would be $expletive useful
Allowing $someVar to get replaced with $someOther
)EOF";

If the objective is to increase contact surface, a tongue-and-groove joint
might be better:

<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13935/20150920_tongue_joint.png> 

This belongs to the edge-to-edge joint category. If interested in all kinds
of possible joints, check out this book (online):  good_wood_joints
<http://woodtools.nov.ru/mag/good_wood_joints/good_wood_joints0001.htm>  .
The cover page of the book shows what's usually called a dovetail joint in
woodworking.

Hiya, 

Thanks Andrew I was attempting to figure out vector3 to euler angles and
matrix conversions and i think i had found some previous matrix conversion
files of yours, and that's the aim of the topic, to be able to skip on the
time searching various libraries and converting C++ code to openscad code,
only to attempt a whimsical idea for a geometry experiment.

Torsten, Thanks for the resources, i'll add them onto the wiki maths
reference when i have a moment free. functions like Distance and vector3 to
euler angles are something everyone would know if they are available, it
saves so much time! I could find 15 of them in C++ and it would take me a
couple of hours to write them to a list and then 2 days to write them to
.scad code, so for that reason it would make sense, if there are 20-30
desireable geometry conversions to do it is much faster to slipstream a
library into the source code.

Runsun nice work it is very cool to have similar maths available when
searching for ways of doing a geometry task, because it can be various
different options, it makes a more powerful control over the pc to have
maths expressions always available. I will write a list of all the functions
i use often in C# here and from the previously suggested resources, matrix
quaternion vector conversions and rotations they are standard reference for
everyone?!?

yep. used to do woodworking 15+ years ago.

dovetail was the wrong word to describe this.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Why not to save the rendered objects also at the session
	end.
Message-ID: <1442797817858-13938.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi,
I?m modeling a printer in openSCAD. Since moving the composit object with
the mouse is an headache, I followed the advise of some forum users and
started to render the individual components to speed up the composite view
although loosing the color advantage. The components take more than one hour
to render. This means that at the next modelling session I have to wait lots
of time if I want some fluidity in the view.
Nowadays disk cost is not so important and 4GB is the space taken by a movie
that saves and loads in one minute. So instead of waiting an hour it's
better to spend some disk space and wait 2 minutes. This could be a saving
option on the file menu. Am I saying something stupid? Is this easily
feasible?  
Thanks for your comments.
Kind regards

I just checked the forum (nable) and mailing list settings for you and they
look normal.
I think the issue is in your yahoo account, you may want to poke around
there.
Your posts (after they are sent) are still getting dropped as spam by gmail.

Remember you may need a little bit of clearance, so they will slide together
without forcing out all of the glue.

Tongue and groove is a joint intended to not-be-glued, as it makes for  poor
joint strength in tensile loading across the joint, but good strength
without glueing transverse to the tongue. Wood joints have in the past been
developed with the properties of hide glue in mind, and that means a very
brittle joint that cracks easily along the joint line. Luthiers use this
brittleness on purpose; when they need to open e.g. a violin for repairs, a
slight hit with a hammer on a glue line will separate  the top plate from
the carcass without damaging the wood, try that with a more modern glue such
as PVA (white glue).
Since the PVC glueyou want to use is rather brittle when dry, and because it
shrinks while the solvent evaporates, a tongue-and-groove joint with play
between tongue and groove would be a weak joint as it is susceptible to
impact failure. If you can, use a tapered joint, such as this:
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n13946/Taper_Joint.jpg> 
and clamp firmly until the glue has set. There is no need to slavishly
follow this design, all that is needed is that the long sides of the taper
are 5-10 times the dimension of the short side to make a joint at least as
strong as the base material. I have built masts that way for wooden sailing
boats. The example picture is from a commercial wood joint, where knot-free
wood has been created by cutting out the knots, and jointing the remainder
with minimum loss of material.

I'll change to a new email soon, save from the pop routing errors. 

in the end i had a .bat file with text:
for %%f in (*.scad) do openscad -o %%~nf.stl %%f 

written in it, and i had to set the PATH using this else it didnt recognize
openscad:

*** GUIDE FOR SETTING WINDOWS PATH ENTRIES FOR CMD.EXE:***
Start the System Control Panel applet (Start - Settings - Control Panel -
System).
Select the Advanced tab.
Click the Environment Variables button.
Under System Variables, select Path, then click Edit.
You'll see a list of folders, as this example for my system shows:
C:\Program Files\Windows Resource
Kits\Tools\;%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem;C:\Program
Files\Support Tools\;C:\Program Files\Common Files\Roxio
Shared\DLLShared;C:\Program Files\Common Files\Ulead Systems\MPEG;C:\Program
Files\Intel\DMIX;C:\Program Files\Executive Software\Diskeeper\;C:\Program
Files\Bonjour\;C:\Program Files\QuickTime\QTSystem\;C:\Program Files\Misc
You can add additional folders that you want to include in searches. I add a
"C:\program files\misc" entry into which I place my standalone utilities,
instead of copying them into C:\windows. Click OK.
You'll need to restart the processes (e.g., command prompt) that use the
system path to see the added folders.

I ran the command on some files from kit wallace's website for a test and
about 1/3rd of the .scad files were processed.

So i ran it on a couple of dozen of my .scad files and only 1/20 files was
processed. If i run the program without the -o command, it opens 20 windows
at once, all of them have empty code windows except for one of them that had
one line of code in it.

Good idea. I've been using similar feature in my code for over a year. It'd
be nice if it is builtin, which would speed up significantly.

Here are some examples of mine. I use {_} to indicate a blank to fill, and
it's also easy to type:

> _s ( s,arr,sp="{_}" )=str ( tested:6 ) (mode:12)
> 
> | 0> _s("2014.{_}.{_}", [3,6])= "2014.3.6"

> | 4> _s("2014.3.6", [4,5])= "2014.3.6"
> | 5> _s("{_} car {_} seats?", ["red","blue"])= "red car blue seats?"

I'd also strongly suggest another addition to the string syntax: *allow '
(single quote) in addition to the current " (double quote).* In my
application "a string inside string" is used frequently. It's another
nightmare (other than the unrecognized \n) to have to type \" each time.
It's not only time wasting but also hard to read. I end up with another
approach, using ` instead of \", to quote an internal string. Then when read
out, I use a parser (written in Openscad) to scan and replace it to ". Yes,
it's crazy. But that's the only way I know.

MichaelAtOz wrote

Don't like it. Iike I said above, single quote(') is best to be used for
internal string.

Better than my current approach.

That'd be a welcome change.

No problem with me.

In summary, I'd support:

1) "string 'inside' a string"
2) string substitution (both blank-filling and key-word substitution)
3) Some way to recognize line breaks in a string, preferring """ (triple
double quote)

ok it seems like it's working although perhaps it's not totally there, here
is what i did:

had to rename all the files with spaces " " to "_"  because cmd.exe didn't
see them, 

to do that:  

1/ run powershell.exe from system3d/windowspowershell or just the run
console
2/ type cd "D:\my dir\batch dir"
3/ do this powershell command:   Dir | Rename-Item ?NewName { $_.name
?replace ? ?,?_? }
4/ then run the script from a .bat file... FOR %%f in (*.scad)  DO openscad
-o %%_nf.stl %%f 

we can also write batch files from powershell for windows it's the new
cmd.exe since 2009 it has more flexibility and more ledgible, but it's still
an entirely new code so only for those who want to learn powershell syntax.

You can put file names in double quotes for spaces and the like,
but I strongly recommend make.

Just my $0.02

the files would be in a double quotes with a wild card in the current
directory, i don't know if i can write "%THIS_DIR%*.scad" kind of directory
so that the batch file can run on any pc and be a portable windows option
for batch processing scads, for others too, that's the intention. anyways it
works, will see if cmd.exe crashes after 10 files or something, quite
possible. i am after a one click solution for others and myself, not
learning powershell, batch, and makefile just so that i can make my slow
scad files :)

Better to use Python than shell scripts as they are simpler and more
readable and run on any OS.

No need to rename files, just use:

FOR %%f in (*.scad)  DO openscad -o "%%_nf.stl" "%%f"

make and python are great if you already have them installed, but overkill
in this case.

Yes, although that only works if make knows about all the dependencies.
Otherwise a simple Makefile will only work when changing the top level
scad file.

In theory OpenSCAD can write the dependency information to make it work
in the general case, but I've never tried that yet.

Could you describe your new workflow with batch processing Tim?  I have been
busy with complicated projects in OpenSCAD and have come up with a workflow
that makes sense to me, but I am keen to learn any real programmers' best
practice.

I currently have a split like this:

1) Library files I use all the time in 3 groups:
	SCAD I have made
	SCAD I have borrowed from others :)
	STLS
2) Global parameters file, which contains:
	Include/use commands to bring in the above
	All my project specific measurements 
	Tolerance/Fudge factors
	variables I may change
3) Sub-assembly files
	Intermediate calculated parameters
	Modules for each component in the sub-assembly
	2D rendering for any laser cut parts
4) Final assembly
	Include files for the components above
	Call the modules from the sub-assemblies, in colour where
appropriate.

Any comments or suggestions on this, and how I could fit in batch processing
where I need it?

Cheers,
Alex

To be frank, I am just making analogy with C language workflow:
i.e. output .stl file depends on the relevant .scad file AND all its 
dependencies - I guess the dependencies list includes the global 
parameters file, include files, imported .stl-s and the like.
If that .stl should be generated with the same makefile earlier - this 
is Ok, make can handle it.

I am not aware about details of your current workflow to say something 
more detailed :-(

Beware, make can act strange when fed with paths or file names
containing blanks, non-ASCII characters  or reserved characters like
ampersands or braces. This problem seems to be worse when using make on
non unix systems, btw. In hugin (http://hugin.sourceforge.net/), make
has been used for generating panoramas from multiple input images, but
it had to be replaced with a processor of our own in order to overcome
these problems.

With kind regards

Sorry, Runsun, no blog. One of the applications of tongue and groove is in
floor boards, which are nailed to the substrate and where the tongue and
groove's key purpose is to suppress warping. But parquet is glued, using
either a latex (rubber) or bitumen based glue, with enough mineral filler
added that it can bridge 1 or 2 mm gaps, and therefor not tongue and
grooved. But Laminated Flooring has a "click-on" edge, a variant of tongue
and groove, that permits the boards to keep together without nailing or
glueing. Laminated Flooring just free-floats on a thin mat of styrofoam.

Since we talked about a little bit woodworking in the other  thread

, I thought I might as well share my work designed in OpenSCAD. The project

Thanks for the info, wolf. 

I just started a thread  Openscad and woodworking
<http://forum.openscad.org/OpenSCAD-and-Woodworking-tp13966.html>  . I'm
totally on the entry level in woodworking. The project in that thread was
done with nails and screws without any particular joint. But, lots of fun
and satisfaction.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Length of vector members
Message-ID: <1443104944464-13971.post@n5.nabble.com>

When using len() for the length of vector members, a single numeric value
returns undef rather than 1.

Examples:
 
 a = [[1,2],3,"string"];
 
 echoing the string part and lengths 
 
 ECHO: "a   = ", [[1, 2], 3, "string"], " length = ", 3
 ECHO: "a[0] = ", [1, 2], " length = ", 2
 
 so far so good, but
 
 ECHO: "a[1]   = ", 3, " length = ", undef
 ECHO: "a[0][1] = ", 2, " length = ", undef
 
 no, it is not related to having a mixed vector
 
 b=[5,4,3,1];

 ECHO: "b   = ", [5, 4, 3, 1], " length = ", 4
 ECHO: "b[0] = ", 5, " length = ", undef

 for the string everything behaves great
 
 ECHO: "a[2]   = ", "string", " length = ", 6
 ECHO: "a[2][1]   = ", "t", " length = ", 1

I think that is correct because a single number is not a vector and hence
does not have a length. It is different from a vector of length 1.

I also make use of it to test if an arg is a vector, or a scalar.

The len() function is only defined for vectors and strings. It returns
undef for any other type of argument. Lots of code relies on this behaviour
so don't expect it to change.

Ok, so it is intentional for a reason, not a bug.

Would it make sense to include examples such as this in the

Message-ID: <0CEDCB42-E43C-4C2A-B72D-C25CF34BF593@kintel.net>

Hi all,

I?m currently exploring ways of making design for 3D printing more accessible to a larger audience, by offering better design tools using the same core design concepts we?re using in OpenSCAD.
This is still super early stage, and as a start we?re launching a survey to help us understand pain points among actual users of 3D printing.

If you have 10 minutes to spare, please consider participating:
https://shapefactory.typeform.com/to/MkElQc?source=OpenSCADMailingList

Cheers,

 -Marius

PS! The goal of my endeavors is to create something sustainable in this domain, which includes being able sponsor OpenSCAD development activities. I?ll share more info once I have a better idea of where I?m going with this.

I think examples of this in the manual would be useful. That was actually
what I was working on when I discovered this unexpected behaviour.

Marius, the survey spends a lot of time discussing subscriptions. The
moment i saw that i lost interest in the product. I and many other people
will never buy a subscription product because it allows a vendor to hold
customers hostage.

I will always only buy a product that i can run localy on my own computer,
storing the data in my filesystem, without having to pay rent to keep it
working.

Hear, hear. I agree 100%

I started the survey, but it asked a lot of intrusive and frankly stupid 
questions, so after several minutes I gave up and abandoned it. For 
example it asked me if I owned a printer, to which I replied yes and I 
use it at home. Then it continued for several questions asking why and 
how I use printing services, even though I tried to tell it I have no 
intention of using such things. There were also other things that I 
reacted upon, but to keep it short I have left it out. I question if 
this is a useful survey as it easily alienates people.

I will only use software that allows me to run it off-line and on as 
many computers as I like. I will not accept software that collects 
information about me or my activities. I do enjoy OpenSCAD the way it is 
and hope focus will be on improving it, i.e. making it more flexible, 
faster.

Agreed, i told it i own a printer (3 in fact), and it immeadatly asked me
about how i rent or buy printing services, i said i dont, it then asked
about which online services do i print with, i said none because i own a
printer. The subscription section was even more annoying and nonsensicle,
it asked me if i subscribe to any services, i said none. It then asked how
much i spend per month on subscriptions,  did i not just say none, and then
to rub in the fact was not actualy interested in my opinion, it asked how
much i would pay for a subscription. Guess what the answer is......

This kind of business model is called "rent seeking" and is universaly
distained.

I've written an advanced version of a batch file which formats the info's
legibly and states the time of every file and the source directory and halts
at the end.

While I understand Tim's position, I would prefer that I have a tool 
that is supported by a strong underlying development team, and one way 
to do this is to ensure that a modest but continuous income stream is 
available.  I would happily pay, say, $25/year to have OpenSCAD become 
such a robust product.  Not sure I would pay $100 or $200/year, as 
SketchUp has started to require.  My reaction to that was to stop paying 
entirely.  But I still have a working copy of SketchUp, just not a 
current one.

We have just been through the same situation with jetbrains, who produce
development tools, they attempted to shift to a subscription model that
shuts down the product when you stopped paying. Several 100 customers put
them straight. They have backed off and now provide perpetual licenses
again.

Thier move was universaly reviled.....

One more, and then I will stop.

SketchUp provides a perpetual license to me for the software I paid for, 
but I can stop funding them and not get access to their newer 
technology.  Seems fair to me.  And to them.  They have an incentive to 
give me must-have features, and I get to decide whether those features 
are worth what they are asking.

We are used to everything being free on the web, but that is not a model 
that can fund the development of some of the products that we love.  It 
makes sense to me to pay a modest fee to ensure that products like 
OpenSCAD continue to grow and improve.

The SketchUp model provides free access to most features, with payment 
needed to use some of the high-end features.

Perhaps rather than simply saying "reviled" we might want to explore, as 
a community, how to fund OpenSCAD in a way that is acceptable to the 
majority of us

Im happy with that model, what im not happy with is software that phones
home, and stops working if i decide not to continue paying the
subscription. I will want to continue using the version that was active at
the time that my license ran out. I also dont want companies reaching
periodicaly into my pocket and pulling out money just to keep running tne
software.

If you make the cost and form factor for the paymrnts too onerous, then all
that will happen is the project will fork.

Hello, just to let know, a small article about 3d-printing and openscad was
published in a collection of articles for school teachers in Saint
Petersburg (in Russian).

Some screens of printed pages with OpenSCAD screenshots:

The funding of the open source projects we all love and derive benefit from
is certainly important, and it would be nice if there were an easy way for
people to e.g. subscribe $2/mo to ongoing development.

Openscad is listed on https://www.bountysource.com/teams/openscad/bounties
but I think essentially no-one has heard of it, and as a supporter you make
lump sum donations for your favourite issues (which may or may not get
worked on). It has the benefit that anyone who contributes to developing
could claim a bounty, but it's not a dead-easy system for a supporter.

Another alternative that I only heard about a few days ago is
http://www.patreon.com/, which lets people be patrons of their favourite
artists/content providers -- sort of like a monthly subscription but I
think it is linked to releases of new content (in the openscad world this
might be releases, nightly builds, commits?). E.g. this might let people
subscribe at a max of $2/month as long as development is still happening.
Presumably then there is the issue of how any funds get distributed though.

Neither sounds perfect. Perhaps the bountysource guys could add a "I don't
know or care about 'issues' but just want to support the project"
subscription option?

Cheers,
Len.

Thanks for the link - I had no idea that existed (neither that site nor
that openscad is registered there).

there's "support openscad" button there, isn't that unrelated to any
specific task? It do allow you to send money without asking you
anything. It shows for e.g. 3 ppl give money this month ... you can give
money "this time only" or you can "subscribe" and make a scheduler to
send money monthly .. isn't that exactly what you suggest here?

Filled it out. Any chance the results would be made public, in aggregate?
It'd be really interesting to see how the community responded, especially
since the talk here seems to be trending towards extremely skeptical of the
questions.

Interesting, I've never encountered that before. Then again, I've never tried
except on linux!

Otherwise, I'd say a Makefile is the way to go. Check out some of the reprap
designs for great examples of make+openscad.

Indeed!! I was only familiar with the one-off issue-based option, from my
previous experience with it -- it looks like that subscription option is
new: https://salt.bountysource.com/

FWIW, I really like the Patreon model, where I pay a small sum per month 
to encourage an artist to do something I like, but with no pressure or 
contract. It would be trickier to do something like that for a 
distributed team, but I, for one, would be interested in sponsoring a 
few of OpenSCAD's top contributors to work on it more. Say, $5 / month 
each to three of them or so. Obviously, that would only work if many 
others felt as I do.

I'm curious if there's other services like Patreon that are better 
suited to open source software teams.

Hi Yona. You can already support OpenSCAD at
https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/openscad
<https://salt.bountysource.com/>, which uses a Patreon-like monthly
subscription model.

Thanks, Doug. Done. Thing is, I've been using OpenSCAD daily for at 
least a year, and I never knew that I could contribute that way. Perhaps 
a discussion about promoting that donation model, in the software 
itself, or in another easily-noticeable place?

I would like to plumb a model steam engine. How do I bend a rod around the
boiler to represent pipes? Just give me an example around a cylinder.  Down
the side then turn, then up around the cylinder.

Another issue you may encounter regarding subscriptions is that in some 
corporate cultures a subscription is forbidden.  Especially true in 
cases where each and every time money goes away there has to be a paper 
trail.

For example, the company for which I work is OK with paying for web 
hosting, because it is a "fixed expense" every two or three years.   A 
monthly subscription is not allowed.  Several of my states' departments 
have no problem spending money as a "one time fee", but commitment to 
pay every month is absolutely not allowed unless you can make a case 
very convincingly to people much higher up the food chain.  For example, 
my state's vocational rehabilitation program will buy software for 
people with disabilities (who are going to college or seeking 
employment), but absolutely will not do anything resembling a continuing 
commitment.

--------------------------

On a personal note, I am OK with having a free base package, then paying 
for new features. I have no problem paying for software that I am using; 
the physical tools in my shop and kitchen and studio were all bought at 
some point.

I am not OK with software that phones home and stops working if 
out-of-date.  When I was a broke college student, I paid about $500 
(well over a year's savings) for a 3D package.  It was not a 
subscription, it was a one-time license fee.  It phoned home every time 
it was in use to validate.  For starters, this meant that when the 
Internet went down temporarily, the software would not run.  More 
importantly, the company that handled the validation servers for the 3D 
software folded after another couple years.  This left my software 
(which I had paid for) unable to start because it could not validate; 
the company which actually made the 3D software was more than happy to 
sell me an upgrade to the software (including new activation servers) 
for another $300 or so.  This is a very unpleasant way to learn about 
vendor lock-in.

I have also seen $$$$ accounting programs that stop at seemingly random 
intervals with no warning.  "You now have more than 14499 entries in 
your inventory?  You need to order the 'Professional Premium Business 
Upgrade Package, $1400.  If you don't pay up the software won't even 
start, you can't sell a single item, and your employees won't get paid 
this week.  You can't even remove items from inventory because the 
program won't start because you are over the arbitrary limit!"

I routinely see people who haven't used AOL in years but are still 
paying AOL $30 a month because cancelling AOL is such a onerous hassle.

These sorts of shenanigans make people very cautious about buying 
software.  "Burned hands are the best teachers about fire" is the 
saying, and there are a lot of burned hands on the Internet.

hear, hear! Ezra. That's just about the best piece of evidence against
subscription services I have ever heard!

Just to be clear, Marius has not proposed changing OpenSCAD to use a
different licensing/distribution model. Tim used the word "fork", and that
won't be necessary.

Marius is attempting to create a new 3D printing service or product with a
for-profit business model, he told me it would be web based, and I think he
wants to use the profits to fund OpenSCAD development.

What about Kate? It's a Qt application, it's Linux, it should fill the bill
if you are looking for a way to see how it's done. They used to have tabs,
which is a good way to indicate multiple open windows - I hate the global 
approach a la Ubuntu global menu. 

If, on the other hand,  you are just looking for a widely used menu format,
look no further than Firefox. It allows you to open new instances in new
tabs, or to have separate windows. What it does not have (Kate used to have
it years ago) is an option to convert a tab into a separate window, useful
if you change your mind at a later stage.

I know that the original post was not talking about making OpenScad subscription-based, but it is good to take the temperature of the community.  I truly appreciate all the work that has gone into OpenSCAD.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Animating gif with 3D rotation
Message-ID: <1443328366737-14011.post@n5.nabble.com>

One reason that I chose Openscad is its animation. As such, Kitwallace's 
excellent approach
<http://kitwallace.tumblr.com/post/85663417144/openscad-animation-view>   of
animation gif and avi is a treasure to me. It allows users to create a
presentation of an object rotating from 0 to 180 and from 180 back to 0
about the z axis. 

But sometimes an object is best understood by viewing it in all directions.
So I took it a little further to create this simple function:

>     module animateRot3d( t=$t, loc=[0,0,0] ){
>     
>         tt = 540*t;
>         rot = t< 1/3 ? [ tt,0,0 ]
>               : t<2/3 ? [ 180, tt-180,0 ]
>               : [180,180,tt];
>         
>         translate(loc)
>         rotate(rot)    
>         translate( -1*loc) children();
>     } 

when operated on shapes under the animation mode, it executes rotations of
0~180 in 3 directions:

>     animateRot3d(t=$t)
>     MyObj();

 
You can check the "[ ] Dump Pictures" option under the animation mode to
save the output (*.png), and use KitWallace's approach to make gif or avi.
The following is my first try:

Two more examples:

*Scadx* is the name of the lib that I've been working on :
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n14012/scadx_animate_test_crop.gif> 

Here is the code to generate the *.png files:

The oloid is a good example of a model that's hard to visualise in the 
three axis rotation.
What do you think about adding a simple ancillary origin(3-axes) model 
to the scene so the user can keep track of the direction they are 
looking at ?
Other models like a grid or even the global axes might also be visually 
helpful.

Or you just drag the tab away from the line of tabs and you will get a new
window and you can drag tabs from one FF window to another.

This page with a conway operator in openscad is crashing the program totally
when running a preview mesh, openscad runs and echos some values and then
the program is closed by windows.

That's odd, it works fine for me, rendering a solid-edge (shell)
tetrahedron.  ( on openSCAD version 2015-06-14 on a Windows 7 machine.)

Looks like it triggers a bug that was fixed after the release. It
crashes with 2015.03-1 but works fine with the latest dev version.

it works in 2014.11.09 !

That is a clever special case work-around for a missing feature: a 
general sweep function that can take a 2d shape and sweep it along any path.

Thank you for this inspiring example.

The code for using the generalized sweep() function is very similar. If you're
using a new enough OpenSCAD, I recommend that you use that instead. sweep.scad
is in
https://github.com/openscad/list-comprehension-demos/blob/master/sweep.scad, and
the transformations you can use are in
https://github.com/openscad/scad-utils/blob/master/transformations.scad

Examples on how to use sweep.scad can be found in list-comprehension-demos as
well.

Click a tab and drag it outside the window and a new window with that
tab will open.

In which I used a python script,  runscad.py
<https://gist.github.com/runsun/995250a8002386ab9abc>  , which is designed
to run a scad file multiple times, with the ability of, among other things,
generating animation png files. automatically.  See the example usage given
above in the code, or visit the gist page.

Subject: [OpenSCAD] Difference - Beehive - Sorta
Message-ID: <1443472816247-14030.post@n5.nabble.com>

First of all, please excuse me for being vague in the title, I really can't
explain my problem very well in few words. Mind you, English is not my
native tongue and though through practice I have become fluent, I am too
ignorant when it comes to terminology.

So.

I am making an ellipse. I have taken the equation, made a function that
gives me a quarter of the ellipse and then I use a loop that through a use
of the polygon creates the shape, which is the extruded and rotated. So far
so good.

What I want to do is to remove bits from the top part (the edge of the
curve?). These bits would have to
->have the shape of hexagons (hence beehive in the title)
->be vertical to the curving surface of my extruded ellipse (which I suppose
can be done by a use of derivatives, for which I have already made a
function)
->keep an equal distance between each other

In other words, what would ideally result would be a beehive shape curved as
an ellipse.

I hope I have explained my case.

For reference, here are the bits of code I have:

function f(x,R,L) = sqrt(pow(R,2)-pow(x*R/L,2));
where R is the maximum height and L the Length

function r_f(x,R,L,x1,y1) = (R*x1/(a*sqrt(pow(a,2)-pow(x1,2))))*(x-x1)+y1;
Please don't shoot me, I used an online tool to calculate the derivative
because we haven't covered that part of the syllabus at school yet, so I
have no idea how wrong this could be.

The piece of code that creates the quarter of the ellipse is this:

rotate([90,0,0])
linear_extrude(height=8,center=true)
for(x1=[0:step:Length-step]){
    y1=f(x1,Radius,Length);
    x2=x1+step;
    y2=f(x2,Radius,Length);
    polygon([[x1,0],[x1,y1],[x2,y2]]);
    polygon([[x1,0],[x2,y2],[x2,0]]);
}

P.S.: I understand that my code is a bit inefficient, but please bare with
me.

Let me first give you the bad news - what you want to do cannot be done. With
that I mean using regular hexagons on the surface of a three-dimensional
shape. That you want a shape in three dimensions I take from your reference
to a beehive.
Why not? Go back to your geometry classes years ago. There you were taught
about inner and outer angles. Add up the outer angles of a triangle, square
or hexagon, you name it. They all add up to 360 degree. Now build a second
ring around that triangle, square or hexagon. If you can lay new ones all
around the original one without a gap, you cannot build a three-dimensional
shape from them. Regular polyhedrons (called Platonic bodies, see Wikipedia)
can have as outer surfaces only regular triangles, squares or pentagons -
nothing else is possible.

So - if not accurately, what about approximately?

There is a standard way to go about constructing shapes that are not within
the library. Google for the equation of the shape you want in polar
coordinates. In your case, since you want, I assume, a three-dimensional
ellipse (called an ellipsoid), google for 

ellipsoid equation polar coordinates

With the equation found there (by the way, your equation,function f(x,R,L) =
sqrt(pow(R,2)-pow(x*R/L,2));, is the equation of a circle in cartesian
coordinates, not an ellipse) you can construct the ellipsoid using little
cubes. The trouble using this method is, cubes have sharp edges, and to
smooth them away, you need lots of them. So it is a good idea to replace the
cubes with square columns, where one of the squares is centered in the
origin and the other on the surface of your ellipsoid. The length of the
column is the radius of your ellipsoid, as per polar coordinate equation.

I'll give you the link 

http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Ellipsoid.html

to all the equations you need, but don't ask me to program it for you. That
is an exercise in itself. But in case you struggle with my words, here is
the code for an ellipse in two dimensions:

 module MyEllipse()     
  for(i=[0:10:360])
  { r=A*B/sqrt(A*A*sin(i)*sin(i)+B*B*cos(i)*cos(i));  //Radius of an ellipse
in polar coordinates
    { rotate(i,[1,0,0])
      cube([.2,r,.1],center=true);
    }
  }
This module by itself produces a sort of star with 360/10 rays. 
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n14032/Star.jpg> 
Hull() it and you get an ellipsoid disk with flat, rectangular sides.
Add two somewhat smaller ellipsoids to it, rotated by half a step, and you
get your first glimpse of what you are after: a portion of an ellipsoid with
hexagons on its surface. But these hexagons are folded, they are not flat.
That is how an approximation ends: you get some of what you wanted, but not
all.
<http://forum.openscad.org/file/n14032/Star1.jpg> 
The full code is
Step=10;

hull() 
  { translate([1,0,0])     MySmallEllipse();
    MyLargeEllipse();
    translate([-1,0,0])    MySmallEllipse();
  }
 module MyLargeEllipse()     
   {A=25;   //long half-axis of ellipse
    B=10;   //short half-axis of ellipse 
    for(i=[0:Step:360])
    { r=A*B/sqrt(A*A*sin(i)*sin(i)+B*B*cos(i)*cos(i));  //Radius of an
ellipse in polar coordinates
      { rotate(i,[1,0,0])
        cube([1,r,.1],center=true);
      }
    }
  }
  module MySmallEllipse()     
   {A=23.75;   //long half-axis of ellipse
    B=9.5;   //short half-axis of ellipse 
    for(i=[Step/2:Step:360+Step/2])
    { r=A*B/sqrt(A*A*sin(i)*sin(i)+B*B*cos(i)*cos(i));  //Radius of an
ellipse in polar coordinates
      { rotate(i,[1,0,0])
        cube([.1,r,.1],center=true);
      }
    }
  }

First of all, thanks. Both of you have helped me immensely. I shall mull over
the subject and then try to create my own solution. I am now aware accuracy
cannot be achieved, but a very close approximation will do for what I have
in mind.

You see, I am a student and there are things that haven't been covered at
school yet.
Nevertheless, according to my book of analytical geometry (the standard for
the student body), the equation for eclipses centered on (0,0) is
(x^2/a^2)+(y^2/b^2)=1, with the foci being (c,0) and (-c,0), where
c=sqrt(a^2-b^2), which means my function does create part of an ellipse.
Then I extrude. I don't really have to make a true ellipsoid, only a
very-much 2d ellipse extruded vertically.

Anyway, I appreciate your answers and I will integrate them to the solution.
I shall update if/when I make my move.

Message-ID: <1443533171042-14034.post@n5.nabble.com>

I just looked at the print version of the manual. No, I'm not a glutton for
punishment. I looked at the online version of what would be printed, rather
than actually print it.

I was pleased to see that the changes I had made were reflected in the print
version. However, I did find a problem with order.

I made extensive changes to the section  *Primitive Solids*. In the online
version it is in its rightful place after the *Introduction* and before
*Conditional and Iterator Functions* 

In the print version it is instead later between *String Functions* and
*Transformations*. Also, all the section headings are missing.

What did I screw up, so *I* can fix it, and avoid the problem in the future?

We had a long discussion about extrusion along an ellipse some way back:

You'll probably find some ideas there.

I think the issue is at the Wikibooks side. The print version relies on
duplicated information to produce the collection. I don't think it can
work like that without creating issues.

It's probably better to find a solution that is based on a single source,
currently that might mean the offline download script written by Runsun.

ciao,
  Torsten.

Found the order part of the problem. There are 3 independent list for the
order of files which make up the manual.

First is the *Overview* at the beginning of the manual.

Second is *OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language* which determine the
order for the on line version.

Third is *OpenSCAD User Manual/Print version* which determines the order for
the print version.

All have a different order.  I think they should be the same, but before I
change them, I want to think about what the order should be. I realize the
cheat sheet makes this less important, but not everything can be found this
way.

If you have thoughts about what the order should be, let me know

I will collect as many simple maths functions as i can and will write them to
the top of this page in .scad form, feel free to post any 3d manip functions
i will make a neat library in the OP.

Because of the lack of rewriteable variables and the translation of code it
would take a lot longer to make and verify a 3d functions library in .scad
language than just copy pasting a c++ one.  for example lookat function, i
have cubes arranged in a sphere around origin and want to make them all look
at the centre, or any other random point. 

here is look at:

// C++ code
// this code assumes the camera is initially looking towards (1,0,0)
positive z direction
// if you want the initial direction to be along the x or y coordinates then
try swapping
// the order when setting the components
// dir = target direction
// up = a vector which is perpendicular to the camera axis
void LookAt(const vector3& dir, const vector3& up, matrix33& m) { 
        vector3 z(dir); 
        z.norm(); 
        vector3 x( up * z ); // x = up cross z 
        x.norm(); 
        vector3 y( z * x ); // y = z cross x 
        m.set_components(x,y,z ); 
} 

first we have to write the matrix of any objects that need to be looked at:

have to convert position where objects are created to a matrix version using
this:

 // Extract new local position
 Vector3 position = m.GetColumn(3);
 
 // Extract new local rotation
 Quaternion rotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(
     m.GetColumn(2),
     m.GetColumn(1)
 );
 
 // Extract new local scale
 Vector3 scale = new Vector3(
     m.GetColumn(0).magnitude,
     m.GetColumn(1).magnitude,
     m.GetColumn(2).magnitude
 );

2) Make a cube, with the z-side longer than the cylinder

3) Move cube to the edge of cylinder

4) Use the difference() function to subtract the cube from the cylinder
